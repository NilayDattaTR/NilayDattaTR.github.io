								<p>Summer weather is here and so is the <a>Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a>&#8216;s (OSHA) outreach program to help to raise awareness about the risks of working in the heat.  The program is used to help to teach workers and employers and the dangers they face while working outside in the hot, hot weather.  This year&#8217;s program is building on last year&#8217;s campaign.  Too much sun and too much heat on the job can equate to <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work-related injuries in Atlanta</a> and elsewhere.&#8221;For outdoor workers, &#8216;water, rest and shade&#8217; are three words that can make the difference between life and death,&#8221; Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis said.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys </a>understand that there are simple safety steps that employers can take to help to keep workers safe and to prevent heat-related injuries.  Each year, there are thousands of employees across the U.S. who are injured on the job by the summer heat.  If these injuries are not quickly recognized and addressed, heat exhaustion can quickly turn to heat stroke, which can kill a person.  Each year, about 30 workers have died because of these injuries since 2003.  There are a number of job positions that can be affected by the summer&#8217;s heat.   Everyone is warned!  </p>
<p>Labor-intensive jobs face some of the most serious risks.  When the body temperature rises beyond normal temps, sweating just won&#8217;t cut it.  Heat illness can start as heat cramps or even heat rash, but within no time it can turn into heat exhaustion and then into heat stroke if no one around knows how to spot and treat the illness.</p>
<p>Some of the most common occupations affected by heat-related work injuries include landscapers, baggage handlers, farmers, construction workers, roadside workers, roofers, utility workers, etc. Employees are urged to drink plenty of water throughout the job and to take frequent breaks in the shade to stay cool and to avoid one of these injuries.</p>
<p>OSHA is releasing heat illness materials in both Spanish and English to help to spread the word.  The Administration is also releasing<a> materials to help employers</a> to properly train employees on how to spot and deal with these kinds of accidents.  </p>

<p>-Three words:  Water.  Rest.  Shade.</p>
<p>-Drink plenty of water during your shift.</p>
<p>-Take plenty of breaks.</p>
<p>-Take your breaks in the shade and work in the shade when possible.</p>
<p>-Start heavy work in the morning when it&#8217;s cooler out.</p>
<p>-Employers should share precautions with all employees prior to the summer season.</p>
<p>-Workers should be acclimated to the weather.  Never throw a new worker right into the heat.</p>
<p>-Train employees to spot symptoms of heat-related illnesses as well as what do when these symptoms are spotted. </p>
<p>-Plan for an emergency and know what to do.  Acting quickly can save lives!<br />

								<p>Currently, about 80 percent of our state&#8217;s students have worked sometime during their high school career.  Well, summer break is getting closer and closer and more teens will be heading back to the work force, using this break away from school to make some extra cash!  </p>
<p>The <a>Georgia Department of Labor</a> and the federal government regulate child labor. These laws help to make sure that our teenagers are protected from accidents on the job and that they have enough time to complete their school work and other obligations as well.Parents are urged to sit down with the teen worker in their life to make sure that they&#8217;re aware of the rights that they have on the job.  Oftentimes, because of their inexperience, teen workers are likely to overlook or ignore work-related dangers that could cause a potentially fatal <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1654701.html">work accident in Atlanta</a> or elsewhere.  For this reason, parents should talk to teens about what is required of them and what is required of their employer to help to ensure their safety on the job. </p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation lawyers</a> understand that there were more than 17 million workers across the United States who were under the age of 24-years-old in 2010.  These workers only represented about 13 percent of the workforce but accounted for some of the highest counts of work-related accidents.  </p>
<p>One common cause for their high injury rate has to do with the positions that they hold, like those in restaurant where there are knives, slippery floors and dangerous equipment present.  </p>
<p>Knowledge about job requirements and expectations can help to reduce the risks for an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Workers age 16- and 17-years-old:</strong></p>
<p>-Can only work 4 hours on a school day.  </p>
<p>-Can only work 8 hours on a non-school day.</p>
<p>-Can only work 40 hours during a non-school week.</p>
<p>-May not work before 6:00 a.m.</p>
<p>-May not work after 9:00 p.m.</p>
<p>-May not work during school hours.</p>
<p>-Are to be properly trained by employees regarding the tasks that need to be completed on the job.</p>
<p>-Are to be provided with the proper safety equipment to perform the job.</p>
<p>-Should be treated without any form of discrimination.</p>
<p>-Should be encouraged to speak up about any on-the-job dangers.</p>
<p>There were nearly 400 employees under the age of 24 who were killed in work-related accidents in 2009.  More than 25 of these fatalities happened to workers who were under the age of 18.  In addition to these fatal accidents, there were nearly 1,000,000 injuries resulting from work accidents during the same year.  The injury rate for these young workers is about two times higher than the rate among workers who are over the age of 24.<br />

								<p>During the entire week, there will be a safety stand down at construction sites throughout the state.  According to the <a>Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA), the stand down has been orchestrated by the state of Georgia, the Federal Highway Administration, construction contractors, OSHA and many other construction-related groups, companies and safety advocates to help to raise awareness about National Highway Work Zone Awareness Week 2012.  This national campaign takes place from the 23rd of April through the 26th.The stand down will be taking place from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m.  During this time, officials will be conducting work zone safety training to help prevent <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work zone accidents in Atlanta</a> and elsewhere throughout the state.  During this time, officials will be addressing distracted driving and injuries resulting from other traffic objects.  Every year, roughly 77 percent of struck-by deaths involve heavy equipment such as trucks or cranes.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys </a>understand that roadside workers face some of the highest risks for work-related accidents.  This stand down is used to address this very real problem and to help to highlight the importance of work zone safety.  Through the stand down, officials hope to not only raise awareness about the risks for these kinds of accidents but the ability for workers and employees to recognize and eliminate these kinds of hazards.</p>
<p>Employees and employers are urged to check out the campaign&#8217;s<a> toolbox and informational flyers</a>, available in both Spanish and English, to help kick off these efforts.</p>
<p>OSHA strongly believes that by committing 30 minutes to an hour of our workers&#8217; day to safety training can help to significantly increase employee safety morale.  </p>
<p>Would you or your company like to participate?  All you have to do to register your company is shoot an email to <a>Cherri Watson</a>.</p>
<p>Georgia Branch, AGC is now participating in its third year as a part of the OSHA Struck By Alliance for three years.<br />
<strong><br />
Involved in the stand down:</strong></p>
<p>-National Safety Council &#8211; Georgia Chapter<br />
-Pike Electric<br />
-Georgia Power<br />
-The Surveying and Mapping Society of Georgia<br />
-Lamar Signs<br />
-Georgia Tech Research Institute<br />
-The  Association County Commissioners of Georgia<br />
-The Federal Highway Administration&#8217;s Georgia Division<br />
-Georgia&#8217;s Department of Transportation<br />
-3M Visibility &amp; Insulations Solutions<br />
-The Associated General Contractors of America Georgia Branch<br />
According to statistics of 2010 from the <a>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, there were nearly 5,000 work-related fatalities in the U.S.  Construction workers face some of the highest risks for fatal work-related accidents.  Alliances and work-safety programs continue on in the effort to help to reduce the risks of these kinds of accidents and to help keep workers safe nationwide.  Remember to keep safety as a number one priority in your workplace!<br />

Director, Department of Labor</u>, No.  11-12747 (11th Cir. Feb. 6, 2012); <u>see</u> <u>also</u> <u>Nobel v. United States</u>, 216 F.3d 1229, 1234 (11 Cir. 2000).  </p>
<p><a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca11/11-12747/11-12747-2012-02-06.html"><u>Gilmore v. Director, Department of Labor</u></a> is a workers&#8217; compensation case coming from the Eleventh Circuit.  Gilmore (plaintiff) was an employee of the U.S. federal government who was injured while he was performing his job duties.  Because of his status as a federal employee, the FECA was the applicable statute governing his petition process and the review process.  Plaintiff completed a petition for workers&#8217; compensation and supplemented this petition with factual and medical evidence to support his claims.  The Workers&#8217; Compensation Board heard his claims and rejected both his initial petition for back pay and interest, and his appeal of this initial rejection.  </p>
<p>Plaintiff argued that by failing to provide him with an award for back pay and interest, the Board had violated his right to property.  Furthermore, plaintiff argued that the Board failed to comply with his constitutional rights to substantive and procedural due process of laws. </p>
<p>Defendants argued that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case because this was a federal workers&#8217; compensation claim that was governed by FECA and the applicable workers&#8217; compensation channels.  </p>
<p>The FECA governs work related injuries suffered by federal employees.  This Act provides the injured employee with certain benefits under the program such as monetary benefits, wage-loss benefits, and even medical benefits and vocational rehabilitation.  FECA specifies that the person responsible for all determinations surrounding this Act is the Secretary of Labor (Secretary).  After adoption, the Secretary delegated the authority over FECA claims to the Office of Workers&#8217; Compensation Program (OWCP).  </p>
<p>FECA applies to all U.S. civilian employees who are paid with appropriated government funds.  The types of employees covered were extended to include the following:  Peace Corps and VISTA volunteers; federal petit or grand jurors; volunteer members of the Civil Air Patrol; Reserve Officer Training Corp cadets; and non-federal law enforcement officers.  </p>
<p>The court in <u>Gilmore</u> cites relevant law that stipulates that decisions made by the Secretary or the Secretary&#8217;s agents are no appealable to an outside court except where their actions are a violation of a statute or where there is a violation of the petitioner&#8217;s constitutional rights.  Basically, the decision of the Secretary or OWCP cannot be appealed unless they violated the constitution or statute in their determination.  This shows why it is so important to prepare a thoughtful petition initially to receive the best possible award.  </p>
<p>Although the plaintiff argued that the Secretary and the OWCP violated his due process rights, the court held that there was no violation of plaintiff&#8217;s rights because he had notice of the review and he had an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful manner at a meaningful time.  Thus, because the decision and the way the decision was made were in compliance with FECA and the constitution, their decision was final and the court could not review it on a factual basis.<br />

								<p>Eagle United Truck Wash LLC was recently cited with 14 health and safety violations for failing to minimize the risks of <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work-related injuries</a> at one of the company&#8217;s stops, according to the <a>Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA).  The violations were observed by area officials at the company&#8217;s Flying J Truck Stop in Jackson.  The proposed penalties accompanying these violations total nearly $58,000.  The inspection was the result of a complaint filed with the Administration.Two of the violations were the same kinds of violations cited back in 2007, which included failing to provide eye protection for employees who were using various corrosives, including aluminum brightener.  The second repeat violation was issued for failing to provide workers with an emergency eye wash station.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation lawyers</a> understand that employers have a responsibility to help protect employees on the job.  To help in this protection, protective equipment and preventative measures must be executed and work-related hazards must be corrected when identified.  When a company fails to offer these measures and fails to correct dangers to help to make work sites safe and to protect workers, work-related injuries and even death can result.  That&#8217;s why OSHA is here, to help make sure that companies are doing their best to provide safe work places for employees across the nation.  When an injury results because of negligent care, compensation may be provided to the injured.</p>
<p>The inspection of the Jackson facility also landed Eagle United Truck Wash LLC with an additional repeat violation, this one just like the one that it received back in 2009 for letting workers perform maintenance on dangerous equipment without the proper energy control program in place.</p>
<p>The company was also cited with seven serious safety violations, issued as a result of the most recent inspection. These violations included failing to identify permit-required confined spaces when workers were inside tanks, for failing to make sure there was hazard communication training to employees, for failing to cover and minimize exposure to dangerous and corrosive chemicals, for exposing employees to slip hazards, for large holes in the wash bay grates, for various tripping hazards, for various electrical problems, among other issues.</p>
<p>Lastly, the company was cited for neglecting to cover wiring on the wall on the heater and boiler and for neglecting to create and enact a respirator protection program.  Neither of these two violations came with any monetary fines, but they are to be corrected to help to ensure worker safety.  These were both violations pertaining to dangers that would most likely not cause serious physical harm or death but were ultimately still a threat to workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very same chemicals that do a great job cleaning metal can be dangerous to workers if used without the proper protections,&#8221; said William Fulcher, with OSHA&#8217;s Area Office.<br />

								<p>If you have suffered a <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work related injury in Georgia</a>, you may be confused about the future.  </p>
<p>Having an experienced <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Georgia injury attorney </a>explain your rights to you is crucial in obtaining the peace of mind you deserve.<a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/ohio/supreme-court-of-ohio/2012/2010-1770.html"><u>McNea v. Industrial Commission of Ohio</u></a> is a recent Ohio workers&#8217; compensation (WC) case that has piqued interest.  This is a case dealing with the question of whether someone who is receiving WC benefits can lose these benefits if they obtain another job.  The issue here arises with the definition of &#8220;remunerative employment&#8221; in this Ohio case.  </p>
<p>Specifically, does being a drug dealer count? </p>
<p>McNea (Plaintiff) was a city police officer who suffered from injuries sustained while he was acting in this capacity.  In 2004, the plaintiff received WC compensation in the form of permanent total disability (PTD).  Subsequently, plaintiff was arrested for illegally selling narcotics.  He was charged with twenty counts of criminal activity and sentenced to three years in prison.  </p>
<p>The problem in this case arose in 2007 when a commission staff hearing officer (SHO) terminated plaintiff&#8217;s WC benefits as of the day of plaintiff&#8217;s arrest.  The SHO did not agree with the WC Bureau that benefits granted before the date of arrest should be considered overpaid.  The reason this SHO cited was that there was no proof provided that would show that plaintiff &#8220;was involved in sustained remunerative employment at the time of the permanent and total disability hearing.&#8221;  The WC bureau argued this decision regarding overpayment, and sought reconsideration because there had been evidence that plaintiff had made narcotic sales to police informants amounting to $6,200.   </p>
<p>WC laws dictate that no benefits will be awarded to claimants who are incarcerated.  Plaintiff acknowledges this however he argues that there was no evidence that he engaged in sustained remunerative employment from 2005-2007 and that by terminating his PTD award while he was still in prison was a violation of his due process rights.  </p>
<p>This court decided that upon the first date of sale of drugs plaintiff made to police informants, his future compensation would be terminated.  The reasoning the court cites for this decision is that the plaintiff&#8217;s drug selling activity over a several months constituted a &#8220;sustained remunerative employment&#8221; for purposes of WC.  The only requirement for sustained activity is that there was proof of an ongoing pattern of activity.  The court even went so far as to calculate the proposed income that plaintiff could have made over his time selling drugs.  And it was assumed that the plaintiff would not have stopped his drug activity for a while, which would have provided him with a substantial income.  </p>
<p>The court looks to prior case law that cites that even if the claimant is engaged in illegal activity that activity would be considered as sustained remunerative employment.  If a beneficiary of WC benefits is found to be engaged in this type of employment, prior benefit awards can be taken away.   </p>
<p>As to the due process argument, the court found that it was not essential for the plaintiff to have been at his hearing for the termination of his PTD because his lawyer was there.  Because there was no evidence that plaintiff would have offered any evidence at his termination hearing, the court found that his attorney was there to represent his rights; therefore,  this fact did not compromise his rights.<br />

								<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> have watched as the recycling and green technology industries have grown exponentially. </p>
<p>Nationwide, the <a href="http://greenliving.lovetoknow.com/United_States_Recycling_Statistics" target="_blank">Environmental Protection Agency </a> reports Americans compost or recycle 82 million tons each year &#8212; or about one-third of the nation&#8217;s waste.But with industry growth has come an increased risk of accidents. Recently the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=21978" target="_blank">Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration </a> cited Olde Atlanta Recycling with 23 safety and health violations. The citations are the result of numerous safety violations that OSHA alleges occurred at the company&#8217;s Cumming facility. </p>
<p>Safety investigators conducted an inspection in November, based on a complaint. Proposed penalties total $69,200.</p>
<p>Among the allegations: failure to provide a program aimed at preventing machine startup during service; not requiring workers to wear seat belts on industrial trucks; transporting compressed air in PVC; inadequate exit signage; and electrical deficiencies. </p>
<p>The government also accuses the company of not doing enough to implement a noise-monitoring program; of not having enough respirator training, and of failure to do enough to prevent laceration hazards. </p>
<p>&#8220;This inspection has identified several safety and health deficiencies that need to be addressed by Olde Atlanta Recycling in order to protect its workers,&#8221; said Bill Fulcher, director of OSHA&#8217;s Atlanta-East Area Office. &#8220;It is the employer&#8217;s responsibility to provide a safe and healthful workplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>OSHA is working across the green jobs industry to promote safety. </p>
<p>Most people instinctively see green jobs as safe, said Assistant Secretary of Labor David Michaels at a recent green jobs workshop. However, that&#8217;s just not the case. New chemicals, new manufacturing processes and new technology all combine to present unknown dangers. </p>
<p>OSHA is primarily working green job safety in three core areas: Prevention through design of safe technology, creating standards and procedures, and giving voice to a green generation of employees. </p>
<p>One of the latest issues has been the rise in popularity of green roofs in urban areas throughout the United States. Some of these projects are designed and installed by companies with specific experience in green roof technologies. However, landscapers, roofers and other contractors are leaping into the fray. Workers dealing with green-roof technology face risks of accidents associated with falls; lack or proper personal protective equipment; exposure to silica dust; issues involving cranes, derricks and hoists; powered industrial truck accidents; electric injuries and injuries do to heat/cold stress.  </p>
<p>Designing standards and implementing best practices will be critical as the advent and implementation of this technology moves through the 21st Century. As these companies continue to grow, and these manufacturing processes begin to dominate the economic landscape, the safety of tomorrow&#8217;s workers will be at least in part be decided by what we are doing to ensure the safety of today&#8217;s workforce.<br />

								<p>There are many critical questions to be considered when addressing a <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Georgia worker&#8217;s compensation</a> (&#8220;WC&#8221;) claim.   <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/maine/supreme-court/2012/2012-me-5.html"><u>Downing v. Department of Transportation</u></a> (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) shows that it is important to have an experienced <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Georgia injury attorney</a> as soon as you find you suffer an injury from your work duties.One of the first questions that arise in a WC claims is, what classification of injury was sustained.  There are two types of WC injuries, they are the gradual injury and the incident injury.  The incident injury is one that occurs suddenly within the workplace, while gradual injuries are injuries that arise over time because of continuous motions associated with job activities.  </p>
<p>Gradual injuries bring up a lot of complications in WC law, which is why the court in <u>Downing</u> goes into such detail regarding this hotly contested WC issues.  The court affirms the idea that in a WC claim for gradual injury, the original cause of the injury does not have to be the employee&#8217;s job duties however the job duties must be a substantial factor in creating the severity of the injury. </p>
<p>The next issue to discuss in a WC claim is whether the employee&#8217;s injury arose during the course of employment.  To prove this, there must be an identifiable and substantial causal connection between the actual injury suffered and the activities performed as part of the injured&#8217;s employment.   </p>
<p>Furthermore, fact finders meet some confusion when identifying the actual date of injury in a WC claim.  Because of the nature of gradual injuries, this date of injury can sometimes be disputed.  However, the dates that are usually considered in these cases, are the date when a treating medical professional actually diagnosed the employee with the medical condition or when the employee first sought medical attention because of the complaints from this gradual injury.  </p>
<p>The court in <u>Downing</u> discusses all of these issues yet it focuses on one main issue in the claim; whether an injured employee can receive WC benefits in addition to their retirement benefits.  </p>
<p>This case cites an important legal doctrine that controls this question.  This doctrine is called the retirement presumption.  Essentially this presumption states that an employee who has retired and is obtaining retirement benefits, cannot also collect WC benefits.  </p>
<p>This decision comes because Downing suffered from gradual injuries arising from a pre-existing condition.  Downing had spinal stenosis and because of the nature of his work as a laborer, this injury became severely worse.  As cited above, in gradual injuries an employee can still collect WC benefits where their injury was pre-existing but aggravated by their work activities.  </p>
<p>Subsequently, the pain in Downing&#8217;s back, leg and hip was so relentless that he was forced to apply for retirement.  Downing changed his mind about retirement and upon rescinding his application went back to work for the DOT for another year.  </p>
<p>The court reaffirms that the crucial point in the conflict between the rules controlling WC benefit and retirement benefit is the original time of the retirement.  This means that when Downing first applied for retirement, this triggered the retirement presumption.  It is irrelevant that Downing soon after rescinded that same application.  </p>
<p>After another year of working at the DOT, Downing then retired and began working part time for a different employer.  After several years, Downing&#8217;s pain reemerged and he was forced to have spinal fusion surgery.  At that time, Downing was receiving benefits associated with his original injury however he applied for additional WC incapacity benefits and was denied.     </p>
<p>The court in this case was led to address the issue of whether this man would be eligible to collect both WC benefits and retirement benefits.  This determination was contingent on the retirement presumption.  </p>
<p><u>Downing</u> states that where an employee terminates their own employment and receives non-disability benefits from their employer, the employee is not entitled to WC benefits.   Hence, when Downing retired from the DOT and accepted the retirement benefits, he barred himself from future WC benefits.  </p>
<p>Because Downing was unable to prove that there was a &#8220;total physical inability to perform any work that would otherwise be suitable to the employee&#8217;s qualifications, training and experience,&#8221; Downing was unable to recover additional benefits through WC.   <u>See</u> <u><a href="http://www.lexisone.com/lx1/caselaw/freecaselaw?action=OCLGetCaseDetail&format=FULL&sourceID=hgjh&searchTerm=ejLU.fEea.aadj.ebTI&searchFlag=y&l1loc=FCLOW">Costales</a></u>, 832 A.2d 790.</p>
<p>When you are injured on the job, it is so important to know how your future actions can affect any benefits you are entitled to.<br />

								<p>The intricacies of the law controlling <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">work related injuries in Georgia</a> are often overlooked until an injury is actually sustained.  It is challenging to navigate through all the rules when you are injured and just need medical care.    When you do not know whether to apply for workers compensation or insurance benefits, you need a knowledgeable <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1654667.html">Georgia workers&#8217; compensation attorney</a> that can help you get the benefits you deserve.On February 28, 2012 the First Circuit Court of Appeals decided that in Massachusetts a person cannot recover for work related injuries under both an employer&#8217;s uninsured/ under-insured motorist (UIM) insurance coverage and Workman&#8217;s Compensation, except where the employer &#8220;explicitly purchased&#8221;  the UIM coverage with the intention of protecting their employees.  </p>
<p><a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca1/11-1897/11-1897-2012-02-28.html"><u>Baker v. St. Paul Travelers Ins. Co.</u></a>  Basically, in Massachusetts if your employer intended to protect you with the insurance they purchase then you are able to collect from both Workman&#8217;s Compensation and the UIM insurance company.  But if your employer buys the insurance coverage without the specific purpose of protecting their employees, then if you are injured while performing your job duties you cannot collect from the employers UIM insurance company. </p>
<p>The complexities of the law are also illustrated in third-party liability claims. In general, workers&#8217; compensation was created to reimburse employees for loss due to injury on the job, while protecting employers from lawsuits that could put them out of business. Thus in most cases a personal injury lawsuit cannot be brought against an employer. However, a subcontractor, third-party vendor, property owner or other at-fault party may be pursued via a third-party injury claim. </p>
<p>This case in point comes after an incident in December of 2002 when Heidi Baker, who was employed by Safety Source Northeast (Safety), was seriously injured in an automobile accident caused by a third party while she was performing her job duties.   Baker collected Workman&#8217;s Compensation benefits but the problem arose when she later tried to recover under the (UIM) provision of the automobile insurance policy her employer had with St. Paul Travelers Insurance Company (St. Paul).  This victim did not know what benefits she was entitled to and was eager to get the help she needed for the injuries she sustained while doing her job.  Do not let this be you.   </p>
<p>State law says that in Massachusetts a person cannot recover for work related injuries under both an employer&#8217;s UIM insurance coverage and Workman&#8217;s Compensation except where the employer &#8220;explicitly purchased&#8221;  the UIM coverage with the intention of protecting their employees.   However, Safety&#8217;s President testified that he is solely responsible for purchasing automobile insurance for the company, and he was &#8220;unaware&#8221; of the existence of the UIM coverage under the Safety policy.  This testimony negates the required intent on the part of Safety to protect their employees. The case decision cited Baker as &#8220;grasping at straws&#8221; when she continue to argue even after she recognized that there was no direct evidence that Safety explicitly purchased the UIM coverage with the intention of protecting its employees.     St. Paul Travelers Insurance Company won this case and it was held that Baker is not eligible to collect on both state Workman&#8217;s Compensation and the employers UIM policy.</p>
<p>When injured in an accident at work you need trustworthy guidance from someone who knows the law and can advocate on your behalf.  As in this case, many people are injured while working and they need help when confronted with the mounting medical bills lost wages and other costs associated with an on-the-job accident.</p>
<p>There is often confusion regarding coverage and what assistance you are entitled to.  When driving is one of your job duties, be conscious of how your employer&#8217;s policy and coverage applies to you.   Without experienced legal counsel to help you navigate the confusion of insurance coverage and entitlements, assistance can seem daunting.   When involved in a job related injury you need to know your state Workman&#8217;s Compensation law and your insurance policy rules before you enter a claim.</p>
<p>We can help direct you through the process of requesting assistance for job-related injuries.<br />
