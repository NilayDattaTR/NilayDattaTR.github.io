								<p>OSHA has cited Thompson Plastics Inc., of Georgia, with 11 health and safety violations and proposed fines of more than $162,000.</p>
<p>Violations include failure to periodically inspect lockout/tagout procedures, which are designed to prevent machines from starting up unexpectedly. According to the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=22731" target="_blank"> OSHA press release, </a>the company also failed to adequately address fall hazards and the dangers of high-decibel noise in the workplace.&#8221;Thomson Plastics previously was cited for some of the same violations found during this recent inspection and is aware of what needs to be done to protect its workers,&#8221; said Bill Fulcher, director of OSHA&#8217;s Atlanta-East Area Office.</p>
<p>The Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration considers in particularly egregious when a company is cited for a repeat violation, and with good reason: <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> understand that employees are often injured in the workplace by known hazards, or as a result of lax safety standards that could have been easily corrected. </p>
<p>A Hartwell, Georgia company, Tenneco Automotive Operation Co. Inc,, was also cited last week for 16 health and safety violations, carrying a proposed total of nearly $80,000 in fines. Among the violations were improper hazardous material handling, trip and fall hazards, and failure to provide adequate rules for respirator usage. </p>
<p>In this case, the chemical in question was hexavalent chromium, exposure to which <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=22716" target="_blank">OSHA reports</a> may result in an increased risk for the development of lung cancer.  </p>
<p>Hexavalent chromium compounds can irritate the lungs, nose and throat. Damage to the eyes and skin have also been noted. </p>
<p>An estimated 5 million workers wear respirators in more than a million workplaces in the United States. Breathing protection helps protect workers against harmful dusts, smoke, fogs, mists, gases, vapors and sprays. In many cases, unprotected or prolonged exposure may result in various cancers, lung diseases and death. OSHA estimates full compliance across all industries could avert hundreds of deaths and thousands of workplace injuries each year. </p>
<p>OSHA&#8217;s General Industry Rules (29 CFR 1910) outline protection requirements, as well as requirements for fitting, seal checks and cleaning. Special rules exist in shipyards, marine terminals, longshoring and construction. Employers must also address airborne hazards through other effective workplace controls (such as exhaust fans). Respirators may not be used to alleviate an employer&#8217;s obligation to reduce airborne contaminants below acceptable occupational exposure levels whenever possible.<br />
<strong><br />
Common side-effects that may result in exposure include:</strong></p>
<p>-Lung damage<br />
-Central nervous system damage<br />
-Cancer<br />
-Cardiovascular damage<br />
-Sudden death<br />
OSHA reports new fit and training requirements instituted by the agency in 1998 reduced exposure risks in the workplace by 27 percent &#8212; preventing an estimated 4,000 workplace illnesses and injuries and about 1,000 deaths each year. Employees who are at-risk have the right to a workplace that is in compliance when it comes to state and federal respirator requirements.<br />

								<p>Spurill Products Inc. was recently cited for more than 25 safety and health violations for exposing workers to risks of<a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html"> work accidents in Atlanta</a>.  The company&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Atlanta was under investigation starting in January as a part of the <a>Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#8217;s</a> (OSHA) Site-Specific Targeting Program.  </p>
<p>This program directs enforcement efforts and resources to work areas that have reported higher-than-average rates of on-the-job injuries, illnesses and fatalities.  All of the fines totaled more than $86,000.The company was slapped with 5 repeat violations.  These violations included neglecting to make sure that workers were wearing both eye and face protection, for failing to create and enforce &#8220;lockout/tagout&#8221; procedures for the energy sources of equipment before workers were going to perform maintenance and service duties, for neglecting to provide employees with the proper training and for not using the proper safeguard equipment on band saws, press brakes and presses.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation lawyers </a>understand that the company was also cited for letting employees do work on floors in the paint area that were covered with slippery liquids and coating.  All of these citations came with proposed fines of nearly $40,000.  The government says all of these violations were repeat violations, meaning that the company or the employer had already been cited for these same, or very similar, violations at least once in the last 5 years.  Some of the same violations were recorded by this company back in 2008.</p>
<p>Employers are required, under federal law, to make sure that dangers and hazards on the work site are minimized.  When risks are blatantly ignored, not only do they run the risks for being busted by federal officials and slapped with appropriate fines, but they also run the risks of injuring employees.  Workers need to be aware of their rights and need to speak up if they observe dangerous working conditions.</p>
<p><strong>The company was also slapped with another 16 violations for:</strong></p>
<p>-Neglecting to enact a comprehensive hearing conservation program.</p>
<p>-Neglecting to provide the proper medical evaluations for employees who wore tight-fitting respirators.</p>
<p>-Neglecting to make sure that workers were provided with the proper hand protection while they were handling phosphoric acids and powder paints.</p>
<p>-Neglecting to provide employees with an emergency eye-wash station.</p>
<p>-Neglecting to properly store acetylene and oxygen cylinders.</p>
<p>-Neglecting to provide employees with the proper training regarding chemical hazards.</p>
<p>-Exposing workers to a number of trip and fall hazards.</p>
<p>-Neglecting to safe guard machinery.</p>
<p>-Improperly using relocatable power taps to power industrial equipment.</p>
<p>All of the listed citations came with fines totaling more than $47,500.  All of these serious violations are the result of a hazard that the employer knew of or should have known about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employers are responsible for ensuring that employees have a safe and healthful work environment,&#8221; said OSHA&#8217;s Atlanta Area Office Director, Bill Fulcher.<br />

								<p>The summer is here and it&#8217;s getting hot out there.  Some of our states hardest workers know all too well.  Our temps are sitting at about 90 degrees day after day.  With the hot, hot heat comes some serious risks for<a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html"> work accidents in Atlanta </a>and elsewhere.  </p>
<p>Each and every year, there are thousands of employees across the country who get sick and are injured because they are overexposed to heat on the job.  Some of these victims even die.  The good news is that these kinds of accidents are completely preventable.  It just takes the right knowledge, education and awareness!According to the <a>United States Department of Labor</a>, virtually anyone can become the victim of a heat-related injury at work.  Employees who are exposed to hot and humid conditions have the worst risks.  If you complete heavy tasks or wear bulky protective clothing on the job, you&#8217;re at an even higher risk.  If you&#8217;re required to work under these conditions, it&#8217;s important that you build up your tolerance for the heat and that you&#8217;re aware of what to do in the event of one of these accidents.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> understand that sometimes sweating just isn&#8217;t enough to help the body to cool itself.  When working in these high temps that we&#8217;ve been seeing in recent weeks in the state of Georgia, a workers&#8217; body temperature can rise and can reach dangerous and even deadly levels if the proper safety precautions are not taken.  These kinds of injuries can sneak up on you, so you&#8217;ve got to be aware.  </p>
<p>Heat illnesses can range from heat exhaustion to heat rash to heat stroke.  It&#8217;s when a worker suffers from heat stroke that death can result.  This kind of injury requires immediate medical attention.</p>
<p><strong>So how do you help to prevent heat illnesses?  </strong></p>
<p>-Remember these three words:  Water.  Rest.  Shade.</p>
<p>-Drink plenty of water throughout your work day.</p>
<p>-When it&#8217;s hot, make sure you take frequent breaks.</p>
<p>-Always rest in the shade.</p>
<p>-Limit your time working in the heat.</p>
<p>-Make sure there&#8217;s an emergency plan in place at your work site.</p>
<p>-Gradually build up your tolerance to working in hot conditions.</p>
<p>-Complete heavy work in the beginning of the day.</p>
<p>-Allow new workers to get acclimated to the work conditions.</p>
<p>-Educate everyone on the work site about the symptoms of a heat-related illness.</p>
<p>-Train everyone in the proper steps to take following a heat-related illness.</p>
<p><strong>How to recognize heat illnesses:</strong></p>
<p>-Weakness.</p>
<p>-Tiredness.</p>
<p>-Pale skin color.</p>
<p>-Sweating profusely.</p>
<p>-Slurred Speech.</p>
<p>-Headache.</p>
<p>-Confusion.</p>
<p>-Dizziness.</p>
<p>-Muscle Cramps.</p>
<p>-Hallucinations.</p>
<p>-Chills.</p>
<p>-Rapid, shallow breathing.</p>
<p>-Light-headedness.</p>
<p>-Fainting.</p>
<p>-Muscle Spasms.</p>
<p>-Red blisters (like pimples) on the skin.</p>
<p>Employees are urged to keep an eye on one another to help to catch these conditions before it&#8217;s too late.  Employers are required to provide workers with the appropriate work conditions and safety procedures to make sure that these accidents don&#8217;t happen in the first place.  Be safe out there!<br />

								<p>Traffic-related accidents are the leading cause of death and injury for workers in the country.  As our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> have been discussing recently, the <a>National Safety Council</a> (NSC) is raising awareness about the leading causes of unintentional injuries on the job through National Safety Month.  </p>
<p>During the last week of the campaign, from June 24th through the 30th, officials focused on workers who sit behind the wheel.  Driving is actually one of the most dangerous tasks that each of us will do each day, whether it&#8217;s for work or for pleasure.  The NSC is here to reveal some important safety tips that can help to eliminate the risks for these kinds of accidents.About 25 percent of all car<a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html"> accidents in Atlanta</a> and elsewhere are the result of a driver being on a cell phone.  Many companies across the United States have enacted cell phone policies in their workplace to keep driving employees from being distracted by mobile devices.  These policies are in place to protect the employee and to help to reduce the risks of accidents.  Drivers are asked to place their cell phone on silent, to turn it off, to put it in the back seat or to store it in the glove box while traveling.  Keeping your phone out of sight and out of mind will help to reduce the temptations of using it while in the driver&#8217;s seat.</p>
<p>Safety officials also encourage drivers to change their cell phone&#8217;s voicemail to alert callers that they may have missed their call because they were driving.  If you must take a phone call, or even make one, you&#8217;re urged to pull over, bring your car to a stop and then continue doing so.<br />
<strong><br />
More Safety Tips for Driving Employees:</strong></p>
<p>-Always wear your seat belt.  Seat belts can help to determine who will walk away from an accident and who will not.  Make sure that everyone in the vehicle is buckled in.</p>
<p>-Avoid taking medications that can alter your abilities behind the wheel.  Many medications and even over-the-counter prescriptions can hinder your ability to drive.</p>
<p>-Make sure you know where you are going and how you&#8217;re going to get there before you start the car.</p>
<p>-Keep your emotions in line.  If you&#8217;re feeling frustrated or agitated, be sure that you don&#8217;t take it out on other motorists.</p>
<p>-Never tailgate other drivers.  Treat others and you would like to be treated.</p>
<p>-Use your horn sparingly.  </p>
<p>Safe driving habits aren&#8217;t only a way to help to reduce the risks of a job-related accident, they&#8217;re a way to help keep our friends, families and neighbors safe.<br />

								<p>As our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> have been discussing, the entire month of June is dedicated to worker safety.  </p>
<p>The National Safety Council has declared it as <a href="http://www.nsc.org/Pages/Celebrate-National-Safety-Month.aspx">National Safety Month</a> and is using each week to focus on a different work hazard.  The goal of the month is to help to raise awareness and to educate workers and employers nationwide about the leading causes of injury as well as offer simple ways to help to reduce the risks of these kinds of accidents.For the third week of the campaign, from the 17th through the 23rd, officials are pushing the Preventing Slips, Trips and Falls campaign.  Did you know that falls are in fact the number one cause of unintentional injuries across the nation.  These accidents account for more than 8.5 million trips to the emergency room each and every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>Slip, trip and fall<a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/"> work accidents in Atlanta </a>are common when the proper safety precautions are not taken.  Officials with the NSC are offering safety tips to help to keep your workplace safe.  </p>
<p>The first and quite possibly the simplest thing you can do to help to reduce the risks of these kinds of accidents is to clear the areas where people walk.  You want to keep all floors clear of loose objects and obstructions.  Common things that can be found in walkways but should be removed are electrical cords, tools, garbage and other debris.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important for you to keep floors clean.  You want to make sure that the floors are dry and that they&#8217;re well lit.  If you spill something, be sure to clean it up immediately.  It&#8217;s important to keep an eye on outdoor walkways, too.  If it snows or rains, it&#8217;s important to get out there and to clear up walkways.  If leaves fall on walkways, those can be dangerous hazards, too!</p>
<p>Did you know that there are things that you can do to help avoid a fall accident? </p>
<p>You should consider getting moving.  Get out there and exercise to help to improve your body&#8217;s flexibility, its strength and its balance.  All of these factors help to keep you healthy and better able to avoid slip and fall accidents.  It&#8217;s also a good idea for you to review your current medications and to keep an eye on your prescriptions.  Many medications, even over the counter drugs, can have a serious effect on your balance and can drastically increase your risks for a slip and fall accident.  You might also want to get your vision checked out periodically.  Poor vision can be one of the main causes for these kinds of accidents, too.  Remember that your vision changes every year if not more frequently so stay on top of it!</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that people usually blame slips and trips on clumsiness and on not paying attention, but the truth is that these accidents are oftentimes caused by external factors, or factors that can be regulated and eliminated with the proper safety precautions.<br />

								<p>Woodland Interiors Inc. was recently cited by officials with the <a>Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) for putting its workers at risk for fall-related <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work accidents in Hiram</a>.   </p>
<p>Safety officials witnessed these hazards when workers were putting insulation into the exterior walls of a new Aldi grocery store.  Employers were working at dangerous heights and were not provided with the proper fall protection.  Employers are required to take care of the proper safety precautions to keep all workers safe on the job.  Failure to do so can result in serious accidents, injuries and even fatalities.The safety inspection into the company and its work practices was all a part of OSHA&#8217;s Local Emphasis Program and National Emphasis Program on falls in the construction industry.  The violations came with a proposed penalty of more than $43,000.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation lawyers</a> understand that fall-related accidents are some of the most common accidents for workers nationwide.  This is especially true for those who are employed in the construction industry.  In the construction industry and all others, employee safety should be the number one concern of employers.  When it&#8217;s not, companies get cited and fined, accidents result and employees can be seriously injured.</p>
<p>The company was handed close to $39,000 in willful violations for letting its workers perform their duties from an aerial lift that was close to 20 feet in the air without providing them with the proper fall protection.  A company gets a willful violation when officials conclude that the employer knowingly or voluntarily disregarded law requirements and disregarded employee&#8217;s safety and health.</p>
<p>The company was also slapped with nearly $5,000 in serious violations for not giving its workers the proper fall protection while installing siding that was more than 15 feet off the ground.  A company gets a serious violation when officials conclude that there is substantial probability that serious injury or even death could result from a work-related hazard that an employer knew about or should have known about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Falls are a leading cause of workplace fatalities, and employers need to ensure workers are protected,&#8221; said director of OSHA&#8217;s local Office, Andre Richards.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Administration launched a new campaign to help to protect workers from fall-related accidents pertaining to working on roofs, scaffolds and ladders.  There were more than 10,000 workers in the construction industry who were injured in fall-related accidents in just 2010.  In addition to these injuries, there were nearly 300 workers who were killed in these kinds of accidents.  Employees and employers are urged to check out OSHA&#8217;s information web page about beneficial ways to help to <a>prevent fall-related work accidents</a>.<br />

								<p>Ergonomics:  It&#8217;s all about creating a work environment to reduce the risks of overexertion and other painful <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work injuries in Atlanta</a> and elsewhere.  To help to raise awareness about the importance of <a>ergonomics</a>, the <a>National Safety Council</a> (NSC) is using its second week of awareness to focus on just that &#8212; ergonomics.The entire month of June is being used as National Safety Month and safety officials with the NSC will be focusing on ways to prevent unintentional injuries.  They&#8217;re focusing on how to eliminate injuries both on and off the job.  From the 10th through the 16th of June, officials are focusing on ergonomics and helping you to find ways to create a work place that works for you.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> understand that there are nearly 3.5 million people who end up in an emergency room every year because of overexertion.  These types of injuries are easily avoided when an employee works comfortably to complete a job.  Many times, these kinds of accidents happen to those who work in an office and are sitting all day at a computer.  We&#8217;re here to offer you a few simple tips to make your desk job a little more stress free.</p>
<p>Failing to set up an ergonomically correct workplace can take its toll on your body.  It can damage your cartilage, joints, nerves, spinal discs, tendons, blood vessels and ligaments.  These conditions are most commonly the result of working too long and performing a job that&#8217;s too strenuous in the same position all day.  It can be the result of making the same movements all day, from working in a position that&#8217;s uncomfortable or unnatural for your body, from standing or sitting too long in a day, from repeatedly using excessive force, from experiencing long periods of vibrations or from dealing with extreme temps for a long period of time.  </p>
<p>Would you know if you were experiencing an ergonomic condition?  Maybe!  Typically, these conditions leave the victim with feelings of pain, tenderness, numbness, with a loss of strength in their grip, swelling and other painful conditions.</p>
<p>So how do you set up your desk to avoid these conditions and these symptoms?</p>
<p><strong>Desk Tips:</strong></p>
<p>-Make sure you&#8217;re sitting comfortably.  You don&#8217;t want to be sitting straight up and you definitely don&#8217;t want to be learning forward.</p>
<p>-Try not to rest your elbows on the desk.</p>
<p>-Make sure that, when typing, your wrists are at a relaxed angle.  </p>
<p>-Position your monitor so that the top of it is right above your eye level.  You want to look down slightly to see the computer screen.</p>
<p>-Keep your most important items directly in front of you to avoid turning and twisting all day.</p>
<p>-Avoid reaching for items excessively all day.  </p>
<p>-Sit with your feet planted firmly on the floor.</p>
<p>Making a few adjustments can make a world of difference to your work area and can help to effectively and comfortably get the job done.  Share the tips above with your coworkers to make sure everyone is comfortable and safe on the job.<br />

								<p>For the entire month of June, officials with the <a>National Safety Council</a> (NSC) are pushing the National Safety Month campaign.  During this time, safety advocates with the Council are working to raise awareness about the importance of safe working conditions to reduce the risks of<a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html"> work accidents in Atlanta</a> and elsewhere.From the 10th through the 16th of June, the NSC will be holding its <a>Ergonomics campaign</a>.  Ergonomics is designing a job and its environment to &#8220;fit&#8221; workers.  It&#8217;s important to do this because working in awkward positions who spend their days making awkward movements can suffer a soft tissue injury, including carpel tunnel.  </p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation lawyers</a> understand that poor ergonomic conditions can cause serious pain and may even lead to disability.  Typically, these kinds of injuries affect the cartilage, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels, tendons and joints.  When work areas are not set up to work <strong>with </strong>an employee, serious injuries may result.  </p>
<p>In general, overexertion injuries affect more than 3 million people every year.  That&#8217;s how many people visit an emergency room each year because of overexertion, which is the leading cause of unintentional injuries in the country.</p>
<p>Individuals who work in an office may be at highest risks for these kinds of accidents.  It&#8217;s important to make sure that your computer monitor is placed correctly.  Just this one move can help to eliminate arm, eye, neck and shoulder fatigue.  Consider following these tips as well to help to eliminate a work-related injury at your desk.</p>
<p><strong>Ergonomics Tips:</strong></p>
<p>-Adjust your computer monitor so that the top of the screen is right above eye level.  You want to make sure that your eyes are looking down just a little bit when looking at the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>-Never keep the monitor closer than 20 inches to your face.  Consider keeping it an arm&#8217;s length from your eyes.</p>
<p>-Make sure your screen is adjusted so that there&#8217;s no glare reflecting into your eyes.</p>
<p>-Keep the center-line of the keyboard level with the height of your elbow.  Tilt the keyboard back 10° so that your wrists remain flat.</p>
<p>-Choose the right chair.  Use an adjustable desk chair. Don&#8217;t be afraid to make adjustments frequently.</p>
<p>-Give your eyes a rest and focus on something that&#8217;s at least 20 feet away from you.</p>
<p>-Stand up, move around and stretch your body occasionally.</p>
<p>-Whatever you look at the most during the day, like the computer screen, place it directly in front of you to help to minimize turning your head.</p>
<p>Setting up your work station is one of the top steps to eliminating work-related accidents.  Remember that even with the best work place set ups, you can still get tired muscles just from being in the same spot all day.  Get up and move around, adjust your keyboard, your monitor and your chair frequently to stay flexible.<br />

								<p>Coal mining was one of the industries that drove growth in the United States.  However, many workers have suffered with the residual effects of this exposure.If you have suffered a <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta work injury</a>, it is important to get the advice of an experienced <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">workers&#8217; compensation attorney</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/05-1620/05-1620-2012-05-15.html"><u>Harman v. DOWCP</u></a> is a recent Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals case which arose because of a dispute over a workers&#8217; compensation benefit award.  Gary Looney (Looney) worked with Harman Mining Company (Harman) in Virginia as an industrial coal miner.  For seventeen years Looney worked doing this heavy type of manual labor.  Two years after Looney retired, he was diagnosed with disabling obstructive lung disease.   Looney argued that this disease was contracted because of his exposure to dust particles while working for Harman.  This caused Looney to enter a claim for workers&#8217; compensation benefits from Harman.</p>
<p>This case hinged on the intricacies of the Black Lung Benefits Act (Act).   This act was created to enable workers who were afflicted with black lung disease to receive workers&#8217; compensation benefits.  Black Lung Disease is the common term used to describe pneumoconiosis.  This is a type of disease that arises in the respiratory and pulmonary systems because of exposure to harmful dusts.  Pneumoconiosis is common among coal miners.</p>
<p>In order to be successful in a workers&#8217; compensation claim for benefits under the Act, the claimant must prove that the reason they acquired this disease was directly related to their work with their employer.  </p>
<p>Harman argued that because Looney was a chronic smoker, it was possible for him to have obtained this lung disease from smoking.  Because there was no unanimous decision among the doctors who testified as to the causation element in this case, Harman refused to pay out benefits.  Even further, Harman appealed the initial decision of the administrative law judge (ALJ) that awarded benefits to Looney.  </p>
<p>This circuit court analyzed administrative, procedural and evidentiary principals of workers&#8217; compensation claims.  It is explained that there is a separate administrative agency that was created in order to deal with questions surrounding workers&#8217; compensation, and benefit awards are to be awarded at the discretion of the ALJ.  Because these agencies have the discretion to make decisions about claims, this court specified its role which is to establish whether the ALJ&#8217;s decision was supported by substantial evidence, factual findings and legal conclusions to warrant the decision.  </p>
<p>In this case, the court held that the ALJ&#8217;s decision to award benefits to Looney was rational and consistent with the federal and state laws for several reasons.  First, in the year 2000 the definition of pneumoconiosis in the Act was amended to include any obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease that arose from coal mining employment.  Next, the court specified that the claimant need only prove that the pneumoconiosis either arose because of their employment as a coal miner or that their work as a coal miner aggravated an already present condition.   </p>
<p>Through a thorough investigation of the evidence presented to the ALJ, this court found that there was substantial medical evidence to prove Looney&#8217;s contention that the dust exposure associated with Looney&#8217;s work as a coal miner had caused this pulmonary disease.  And because Harman failed to support their argument that there was a mistake of fact, its argument was unsuccessful.  </p>
<p>Looney&#8217;s widow received the workers&#8217; compensation benefits she was entitled to after her husband died from black lung disease.<br />

									<div class="entry-content">
								<p>When you suffer a <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work-related injury in Atlanta</a>, you may be entitled to workers&#8217; compensation benefits.  The question then becomes, how will your average weekly wage be determined for benefits purposes?Because this determination is not as straightforward as you may think, it is important to have an experienced <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorney</a> advocating for you.</p>
<p>Recently, the Virginia courts clarified what is required to determine an injured employee&#8217;s average weekly wage for an award of workers&#8217; compensation benefits.  <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/virginia/supreme-court/2012/110349.html"><u>Thorpe v. Ted Bowling Constr., et al.</u></a>, No.  110349 (Virg. May 4, 2012).  Matthew Thorpe (Thorpe) was an entrepreneur who owned a self storage facility and a residential porch railing installation company.  Thorpe employed Eric McMahon (McMahon) at this installation company called Alson&#8217;s Ornamental Iron.    </p>
<p>This case arose when a customer of Thorpe&#8217;s, John Clary (Clary), offered to pay Thorpe and McMahon to assist him on one of his jobs.  Clary was contracted by Ted Bowling Construction (defendant) to install a metal roof and siding on an industrial building.  Clary offered Thorpe and McMahon $5,000 to complete the job as soon as possible; which he expected to occur within a week.  Additionally, Clary specifically stated that he would pay Thrope and McMahon the stipulated amount only when the job was completed.  This agreement was memorialized when Clary wrote &#8220;5000&#8221; on the top of a shop table with soapstone.  </p>
<p>Clary knew that Thorpe and McMahon had never worked with the installation of metal roofing and siding; however, because he knew the railing installation business was slow he offered them the job.  Clary provided the two men with instructions and supervision, as well as all of the tools and materials they would need in order to complete the requisite installation.  The roof where the work was being performed by Thorpe and McMahon has skylight windows which they had noticed immediately upon beginning their work.</p>
<p>Thorpe and McMahon had worked on this project for four days.  On the fourth day, while installing the metal sheets on the roof of the industrial building, Thorpe fell through one of the skylights on the roof.  Because of this fall through the skylight, the impact of his landing caused him to die immediately.  Thorpe left his widow who brought a lawsuit against the defendant seeking workers&#8217; compensation benefits.  </p>
<p>The deputy commissioner responsible for hearing this workers&#8217; compensation claim, began wo hear the evidence over a year and a half after Thorpe&#8217;s death.  The main issue in this claim was surrounding the terms and conditions of the employment agreement between Clary, Thorpe and McMahon.  This commissioner was unable to find Clary, as he had &#8220;disappeared&#8221; after the death of Thorpe.  The only remaining witness to the agreement and the circumstances of Thorpe&#8217;s death was McMahon.</p>
<p>Because McMahon and Thorpe had never engaged in this type of work before, they could offer no evidence as to the prevailing wage paid for this type of work.  The only thing McMahon could offer was the offer Clary made.   </p>
<p>Workers&#8217; compensation benefits are based on the employee&#8217;s average weekly wage.  This is established by dividing the earnings made in the previous 52 weeks of that employment by 52.  Because there was no evidence of Thorpe&#8217;s employment for a fixed period of time, there was no time based conclusion that could be utilized in establishing prevailing wage.  </p>
<p>Thus, the court indicated that the things to be considered when establishing the prevailing wage for workers compensation benefits are based on the wage paid at the same time and in the same area for similar work.  </p>
<p>Because Thorpe was not hired for a long time basis but only for a single project, this court found that it would be unfair to provide his widow with continuing benefit payments.  Therefore, she received only $48 a week for 500 weeks.<br />
