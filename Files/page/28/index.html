								<p>The news for workers has been bad lately across the globe. Of course, one of the worst disasters in history recently took place in Bangladesh when a factory collapsed due to failure to follow clearances and shoddy building materials. This collapse led to more than 1,100 deaths of workers.  Unfortunately, news of this devastating accident is not the only bad news for workers in recent weeks.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta work injury attorneys</a> know that the dangers that workers face are not exclusive to factories half a world away like those in Bangladesh. Workers right here in the United States are in grave danger, in large part because safety laws designed to protect employees are not being enforced effectively. </p>
<p><strong>Workers at Risk in the United States</strong></p>
<p>Within just a few days of the tragic factory collapse in Bangladesh, we were reminded that we also have some very dangerous worksites here in the United States. This tragic reminder occurred when a West Texas Fertilizer plant exploded and caused fourteen deaths and more than 200 injuries. While the explosion happened at night and there were few employees of the plant injured or killed, the explosion still raised questions about what conditions were like at the plant. </p>
<p>It turned out, unfortunately, that federal regulators really had no idea what conditions were like there. This is because the fertilizer plant had not been inspected since 1985. A dangerous plant storing explosive material like the fertilizer plant was storing should have been high on the list of priorities as far as workplace inspections, so this incident could naturally raise questions of where OSHA was and why no one was keeping tabs on what was going on. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the AFL-CIO&#8217;s 2013 report <a>&#8220;Death on the Job: The Toll of Neglect&#8221;</a> answers the question of where OSHA was:  overworked, understaffed and unable to perform inspections that they need to perform. </p>
<p>According to the AFL-CIO:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 837 federal OSHA inspectors available to oversee and regulate more than 8 million workplaces. Even with the 837 inspectors working full time, the significantly shortage of OSHA staff means that a workplace would be inspected just about once every 131 years. </li>
<li>There are very limited penalties imposed on employers who break OSHA safety rules, even when an employer violation leads to death. Criminal charges are very rare since a criminal case is brought only if a willful violation is the cause of an employee&#8217;s death. These types of cases have been brought only 84 times since 1970 when many worker protection laws were passed. Without criminal enforcement, fines are supposed to act as a deterrent. Unfortunately, the median amount that is paid after settlement if a worker dies at work is just $5,715. The fine is even lower for simple citations, at an average of $2,156. </li>
</ul>
<p>The news of this AFL-CIO report raises serious concerns about whether enough is being done to protect workers in the United States. The West Texas fertilizer plant is solid proof that a failure to inspect can have very real consequences, and the tragic collapse in Bangladesh serves as an important warning about what could happen here in the U.S. if regulators don&#8217;t have the power to make employers play by the rules when it comes to workplace safety.<br />

								<p>The workers&#8217; compensation system in Georgia has long been established as a means to protect workers and to ensure that they have medical bills and costs covered if they suffer a disabling injury at work. Unfortunately, some recent changes to the Georgia workers&#8217; compensation law limit the rights of workers to be provided with full benefits after experiencing a workplace injury.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta work injury lawyers</a> know that the Governor signed <a>House Bill 154</a> into law on May 6th, 2013. Understanding the implications of this law and how it will affect your workers&#8217; compensation claim is very important. </p>
<p><strong>Georgia Workers&#8217; Compensation Changes</strong></p>
<p>HB 154 was proposed this year by lawmakers to make some important alterations to existing Georgia workers&#8217; compensation laws. After passing the House and the Senate, the law went to the Governor and was signed.</p>
<p>Some of the changes that are made by HB 154 are positive changes that can help workers. For example, the weekly benefits for the disabled were raised to $525 and to $350 for those who have a partial/temporary disability.  An increase in the weekly benefits maximums is a very good thing for workers struggling to get by under the prior limitations on weekly income from workers&#8217; compensation. </p>
<p>The law also mandates that an employee who is entitled to reimbursement for mileage must receive repayment in a timely manner. According to the rules set by HB 154, reimbursements that are due for mileage need to be paid within 15 days from the date when the employer receives reports. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the law did some good things for injured workers, it also did some bad things as well.  One of those things was to limit the length of compensation to 400 weeks maximum. Under the new law, therefore, anyone who experiences a non-catastrophic injury after July 1, 2013 will be restricted to being compensated for just 400 weeks from the date that the injury first entitled him to benefits. </p>
<p>The new law also changed the rules as far as employees attempting to return to work. Under the Georgia Workers&#8217; Compensation laws, an employee may return to work and do light duty or return on restricted duty even if the employee has not yet fully recovered from his injuries. There is a formal process employers can use to get an employee back to work, which includes making a &#8220;240 offer of light duty.&#8221; Essentially, when employers make this offer, the worker can be compelled to try the light duty job. If the employee is able to do the job, then ongoing workers&#8217; comp disability benefits will be reduced or eliminated. </p>
<p>This process has been susceptible to problems especially since employers are required to resume paying benefits if an employee cannot perform the job for 15 days. Some employees were allegedly taking advantage of this, making a token attempt to do the light duty job for around 20 minutes or so and then claiming pain and going home.  HB 154 said that if an employee attempts to perform the job for less than eight cumulative hours or for less than one scheduled workday, the employer can suspend benefits. The employer can also suspend benefits if the employee refuses to attempt the job. In any of these cases when benefits are suspended, the employee will now have the burden of proving continued eligibility for benefits. </p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that many injured victims really are in pain and cannot work for even 20 minutes, even at a light duty job. This can cause serious hardship for the sickest and most disabled if their employers try to force them back to work. If your benefits are stopped as a result of this new law, it is important to talk to an attorney since you&#8217;ll now have the burden of proving your need for ongoing benefits.<br />

								<p>Recently, the <a href="http://www.rand.org/news/press/2012/05/07.html">RAND Center for Health and Safety in the Workplace</a> funded a study to consider the relationship between the rate of workplace fatal injuries and the rate of workplace nonfatal injuries. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, showed a surprising inverse link between low nonfatal injury rates and high fatality rates.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta work injury attorneys</a> know that there are many factors that affect how safe workplaces are and whether injuries or deaths are likely to occur. This new RAND Center study helps to shed more light on why workplace injuries and fatalities are occurring and on what can be done to reduce the number of workers&#8217; hurt or killed at work. </p>
<p><strong>New Study Reveals Info on Workplace Injury/Workplace Fatality Rates</strong></p>
<p>It may be natural to assume that an area with a high rate of workplace fatalities would also have a high rate of non-fatal injuries and vice versa. After all, employers are more likely to be killed in fields and workplaces where dangerous conditions exist. These unsafe and dangerous workplaces should also be more likely to cause nonfatal injury since the unsafe conditions that lead to the deaths can also harm workers in other ways. </p>
<p>However, the reality shows that the opposite is true. States with the highest number of non-fatal injuries tended to have low fatality rates. States with a lower number of non-fatal injury rates, on the other hand, had a higher rate of workplace death.  This inverse relationship surprised the lead author of the study who indicated that few would have believed an inverse relationship between injuries and fatalities prior to the study. </p>
<p>One possible explanation that is offered for why more people are dying in areas where fewer people are being injured is that better workers&#8217; compensation benefits in these areas both protect workers and encourage people to report workplace injuries. In other words, you might live in a state where worker protections are taken very seriously and where workers&#8217; compensation laws provide comprehensive benefits if you get hurt.  </p>
<p>In a state that takes worker protection seriously, your employer probably goes the extra mile to try to prevent injury from occurring. As a result, worker deaths are less common. Yet, workers who do get hurt will file claims to take advantage of the excellent benefits available under the law. Thus, results a high rate of reported injuries but a low death rate. </p>
<p>Other evidence from the study seems to confirm that tougher worker protection laws can make a big difference in workplace injuries and deaths. For example, states with the lowest nonfatal injury rates and highest fatality rates tended to include Southern States that have lower workers&#8217; comp benefits; fewer unions and lower wages. </p>
<p>Work conditions, in other words, were not as good in these states and workers&#8217; were less protected. These workers may die in higher numbers due to the more widespread disregard for worker safety issues. Yet, because the laws aren&#8217;t in their favor, they may not report every injury that occurs on the job. This results in a high fatality rate but a low rate of nonfatal injuries reported.  </p>
<p><strong>Protecting Workers From Injury and Death</strong><br />
Ultimately, the results of this study seem to emphasize a point that has been made time and again: taking worker safety seriously really can make a difference in reducing the number of workplace fatalities. Employers need to have sufficient incentive to protect workers, and having tough worker protection laws and a strong workers&#8217; compensation system can provide that incentive.<br />

								<p>In the United States, Hispanics make up around 15 percent of the total labor market.  Unfortunately, Hispanics are injured in greater percentages on the job than would be expected based on the number of Latinos in the workplace.  Hispanics, in fact, have the highest workplace death rate of any workers. African Americans, as well, are at higher risk of dying at work when compared to white workers, but the rate of death among African Americans is still lower than the percentage of Hispanic workers dying.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta work accident lawyers</a> know that employers have an obligation to keep all employees safe. An employee&#8217;s race, religion, color, national origin and other protected status should have no impact on how an employer treats an employee at work. Unfortunately, this data shows that all people are not treated equally in the workplace.  </p>
<p><strong>Hispanics and African Americans at the Greatest Risk of Workplace Death</strong></p>
<p>According to a recent <a>ABC News article</a>, 20 percent of all workplace fatalities involve Hispanic workers. This is a disproportionately higher number of deaths than would be expected given that Latinos make up only 15 percent of the workforce. </p>
<p>In 2011, for example, a total of 729 out of the 4,600 workers who lost their lives on the job were Latino. In 2010, 707 Latino workers lost their lives. African Americans also saw an increase in the number of fatalities during this time period while the number of white workers killed went down. </p>
<p>While Latinos are already dying at higher rates than other races and have been for many years, things actually seem to be getting a little bit worse for Hispanics even as conditions get better for many other workers. For example, in 2011, there was a three percent rise in on-the-job fatalities for Latinos when compared with 2010.  This increase was the first increase since the number of Hispanic workers killed at work rose in 2006.  </p>
<p>The increase here was especially troubling because the total number of workplace fatalities among whites declined during the same time period. This widens an already- skewed gap in workplace fatalities among races since Hispanics were already dying in larger numbers at work. </p>
<p><strong>Protecting the Rights of Latino Workers</strong></p>
<p>Employers need to do more to protect every workers&#8217; rights, including the rights of Latinos. One important issue that could make a major difference for Latino workers, for example, is the issue of immigration. According to ABC News, around 500 of the 729 Latinos who were killed on the job in 2011 were described as &#8220;foreign born.&#8221; The majority of these workers were from Mexico. </p>
<p>If some of these &#8220;foreign-born&#8221; workers are undocumented immigrants, these workers may not enjoy the full protections of the laws available to U.S. citizens. Some dishonest and unscrupulous employers take advantage of labor provided by undocumented immigrants and don&#8217;t take safety as seriously since they know that the undocumented workers can do little to complain to authorities or protect their rights. Ensuring that  ALL workers can take action when workplace safety violations are occurring, regardless of their immigration status, could save many lives.<br />

								<p>Dust hanging in the air may seem to be a natural part of many workplaces. In metal shops, for example, there may be flakes, chunks, fibers or fine particles of metal such as magnesium and aluminum. In construction zones and in many industrial and commercial workplaces, it is also common to find various other dust and fibers hanging in the area, including plastic, wood, coal, rubber, sugar or flour or even paper.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta work accident lawyers</a> know that dust can be dangerous for many reasons including the risks to workers when they breathe in dust particles. One risk that many may not think about, however, is the risk that this dust can be combustible. Although the potential dangers of a combustible dust fire may not be the first thing that you think about as a health concern in a dusty workplace, the danger is very real, and is a common cause of explosive fires in manufacturing settings. </p>
<p>Firefighters and emergency personnel must often confront the risk.</p>
<p>To draw attention to the risks of combustible dust fires and to help ensure that emergency workers are protected, Occupational Safety And Health Administration (OSHA) recently published new information on the issue. This booklet is called <a>Firefighting Precautions at Facilities with Combustible Dust</a>. The booklet is written for an audience of first responders who may find themselves responding to explosions and fires where combustible dust particles are present. </p>
<p><strong>The Dangers of Combustible Dust Explosions</strong><br />
From 1980 through today, there have been more than 780 workers injured in combustible dust explosions and there have been more than 130 workers killed in tragic explosions involving combustible dust. </p>
<p>To prevent further injuries and deaths, OSHA advises that firefighters and other emergency responders should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn about the dangers of combustible dust through the use of safety data sheets (SDS). Employers of first responders and first responders themselves should consult these sheets to learn what types of materials can result in combustible dust. Knowing when an environment is likely to have such dust is very important to those responding to or fighting a fire. </li>
<li>Conduct pre-incident reviews. Pre-incident reviews are appropriate when an environment or facility is very likely to produce combustible dust. A pre-incident review would involve an inspection of high-risk facilities so that emergency responders will know in advance about the conditions that they might find when a fire or explosion does occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers in workplaces where combustible dust may be produced also bear certain responsibilities in order to keep first responders safe. The use of a dust protection system, for example, is advised not just to help ensure workers avoid breathing dangerous dust on a regular basis but also to protect first responders. A dust protection system might include abort gates as well as relief vents if it is to protect first responders since these solutions make it possible for burning materials or pressure to be directed out of confined areas. A detection and suppression system may also be advisable. </p>
<p>If employers and first responders are able to understand the risks and take responsibility to ensure that those risks are minimized, fewer people will be injured or killed as a result of combustible dust.<br />

								<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta work accident lawyers</a> know that teens have had a difficult time finding jobs in recent years due to a tough economy and a weak employment market. According to a recent article on <a>NBC News</a>, however, things may be different this year.The NBC News article indicates that the economic momentum over the last several months has been positive and that managers who hire summer hourly workers are reporting that they plan to add an average of 30 hourly workers this summer instead of the 27 workers added last year.  When surveying seasonal hiring managers, 68 percent also reported an intent to hire workers this summer. This is great news for teens who have been hit the hardest in recent years by the economic downturn. </p>
<p>The bad news, however, is that when there are more teenagers going to work, there is a greater chance of young people being injured on the job. Employers need to manage the risks associated with bringing on new employees, especially teen employees, and young workers need to be aware of the dangers they face, which could derail a career and future before it even has a chance to really begin. </p>
<p><strong>Young Workers at Risk of Injury</strong><br />
Young workers are at great risk of injury while performing their summer jobs for several reasons. One issue is that these workers tend to take on lower paying and physical jobs in industries such as landscaping and fast food. Both of these industries have a high rate of injury. In fast food, many things can go wrong from slipping and falling in a restaurant to being robbed to getting hurt when cooking and cleaning up in the kitchen. In landscaping, problems can include injury due to machines as well as due to repetitive stress, lifting injuries and falls. </p>
<p>Aside from the fact that teens tend to work in dangerous industries, they also tend to be in low paying jobs where employers may not always have the best track record of following safety rules. Data has shown that low-wage workers in general are at greater risk of getting hurt on the job than workers in higher paying positions, especially higher paying white-collar jobs. </p>
<p>Finally, teens and young workers tend to have limited work experience. If not properly trained and supervised, teens could make a mistake that causes injury. For example, a teen needs to be trained on using commercial dishwashers and/or supervised when using any type of cooking or dishwashing equipment in a restaurant setting. </p>
<p>Employers who chose to hire young workers ultimately have the responsibility of mitigating these and other risks that teenagers face. Employers need to be aware of restrictions on young workers related to the types of jobs they can do and the hours worked. They need to provide proper training and supervision and create a safe work environment. If an employer fails in these obligations, the chances of a worker becoming hurt significantly increases.<br />

								<p>Construction projects often go into full swing during the spring and summer months, which is great news for workers looking to jump on projects and get some work done. However, with more work being performed, the risk of accidents increases. Construction sites can be dangerous places and workers are in danger of getting hurt in a number of different ways.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta work accident lawyers</a> know that some of the top causes of workplace accidents on construction sites are fall accidents. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has recently issued a <a>Trade News Release</a> about its efforts to prevent fatal falls in construction. The new efforts focus on raising awareness of the fall risk. OSHA  also has a three part <a>Fall Prevention Campaign</a> of which every worker and employer should take notice. </p>
<p><strong>The Steps to Fall Prevention</strong><br />
OSHA&#8217;s national outreach campaign to raise awareness of falls on construction sites is directed towards both workers and employers. Workers can make a point to follow OSHA&#8217;s tips for acting in a safe and responsible way when working at height. </p>
<p>However, ultimately the safety of a worksite is determined by an employer. An employer who provides top-quality equipment and who has adequate safety policies in place is going to have a major impact on reducing the risks of a fall. On the other hand, when an employer creates an unsafe workplace or allows safety violations, a worker could be in danger of falling no matter how careful he is when performing his job. </p>
<p>Employers, therefore, should be especially careful to pay attention to OSHA&#8217;s tips for fall prevention. OSHA&#8217;s three part plan for preventing falls on construction sites includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning: Employers need to evaluate what safety equipment will be required to perform a job and should build the costs of the equipment into their bids. Employers must make all tools including the right equipment (and safe equipment) available on site. Workers should also plan ahead by making sure they have everything they need before getting started on doing any job. </li>
<li>Providing. Employers must provide the right equipment to workers. This includes fall protection equipment, as well as the right types of safety gear, ladders and scaffolds.</li>
<li>Training: Everyone on the job site should be trained in how to perform work safely. Workers need to be trained on how to use all of the equipment they need to use in order to do their jobs. There should also be training on the proper set-up of equipment and on hazard recognition. </li>
</ul>
<p>OSHA has many materials that can be used by employers to offer training. Employers simply need to take the initiative to understand and comply with OSHA guidelines and to use the resources available to them. OSHA&#8217;s new campaign to publicize fall dangers may encourage employers to be proactive about preventing workplace injuries, thus potentially saving workers&#8217; lives.<br />

								<p>With summer approaching, many people will be hiring landscapers to do stonework. Stone cutters and splitters who do this type of work may find themselves busier during the summer rush as a result.  OSHA has an important <a>Safety and Health Information Bulletin</a> for those who work in the stone cutting and splitting industry and as the busy season approaches, every worker and employer should pay attention to OSHA&#8217;s advice.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation lawyers</a> know that stone cutters use many dangerous machines in the course of performing their jobs. Unfortunately, the physical nature of the work, coupled with the tools utilized, creates a situation where many stone cutters are hurt. By following the OSHA guidelines on safety, however, hopefully injuries can be prevented during the summer landscaping season. </p>
<p><strong>The Work Injury Dangers for Stone Cutters</strong><br />
Stone cutters, stone masons, stone slippers and rock cutters all use certain types of tools and machinery when performing their jobs. For example, portable or fixed hydraulic rams are typically used to split stones.   When using hydraulic rams, amputation or other injuries are a real possibility.  Stone cutting machines that have unguarded cutting blades are also likely to cause serious harm when not used properly or when safety measures are lacking.  </p>
<p>In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that more that 180 injuries resulted from using shears in 2010. Shears are a very similar tool to those used by stone cutters.  Of those injured with shears, 100 amputated a body part. The injuries, therefore, are serious and can have a lasting impact on your life in many cases. </p>
<p><strong>Staying Safe</strong><br />
While the work done by stone cutters carries some inherent risk, this doesn&#8217;t mean that workplaces cannot be made safer by taking the right precautionary steps.  OSHA&#8217;s Safety and Health Bulletin suggests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that there is a good machine guarding system in place. A machine guarding system might involve making use of two-handed starting devices; installing barrier guards on the machine, and incorporating electronic safety devices. </li>
<li>Keeping the unit cleaned and maintained. A regular inspection should be performed to ensure that the machine is in good working order. Problems should be fixed when they arise so workers do not have to use a dangerous or broken machine. </li>
<li>Providing personal protective equipment (PPE) for workers. Employers should provide workers with PPE that protects them from known-hazards. The use of safety shields or face shields, for example, is recommended.</li>
<li>Doing a risk-check before starting work. Essentially, this means making sure that the machine and safety procedures are in place. Checking the machine guarding, reading/reviewing the manufacturers&#8217; warnings and instructions; inspecting the machine and making sure workers are where they need to be are all important things to double check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers also need to provide adequate training and supervision to their employees who are performing stone cutting work. Although individual workers can and should try to protect themselves and make sure their job is performed as safely as possible, ultimately it is the employers who establish working conditions and who are responsible for helping workers to avoid injury.<br />

								<p>According to the <a>Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, 117 out of every 10,000 full time workers in 2011 suffered an injury or an illness that caused them to miss at least some time from work. These types of injuries and illnesses are referred to as those requiring &#8220;days away from work.&#8221;Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation lawyers</a> know that any time an employee misses work, productivity is lost. When workers have missed several days of work, then the employee will also be provided with lost wages benefits through workers&#8217; compensation. Unfortunately, the money paid out for a days-away-from work claim does not generally provide a worker with 100 percent of his salary for time off. Thus, both employers and workers suffer when a worker is injured and has to miss work as a result, especially if the injury that the worker endured caused serious or permanent damage. </p>
<p><strong>Who Is Most Likely to Miss Work?</strong><br />
In their report on injuries and illnesses requiring missed work in 2011, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicated that workers in just five occupations accounted for almost 20 percent of all illnesses that necessitated time off of work. These five occupations included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laborers </li>
<li>Attendants</li>
<li>Janitors and cleaners</li>
<li>Drivers of heavy trucks and tractor trailers</li>
<li>Police officers and sheriff&#8217;s patrol police officers </li>
</ul>
<p>Those working in these occupations had an incident rate of injuries that was around five times greater than the 117/10,000 rate applicable to all workers. </p>
<p>Those most likely to be injured and to miss work also included older workers. For example, workers between the ages of 45 and 54 had the highest proportion of illnesses and injuries leading to time off. </p>
<p><strong>Keeping Workers Safe is Better for Everyone</strong><br />
When looking at the list of jobs that cause the most injuries leading to missed work, it is easy to see what they have in common. All of the jobs required physical work, and all involve potentially dangerous work where the employee could put a strain on his or her body or go into a situation where violence or accidents is likely. </p>
<p>While some jobs are inherently more dangerous than others, employers within these industries should be aware of the fact that the injury rate is significantly higher within the field. Awareness of the problem is the first step to finding solutions that could hopefully help make these professions safer for the workers. </p>
<p>For example, having clear safety policies and procedures in place; providing proper training; offering sufficient breaks; and rotating workers to avoid repetitive stress on the body could potentially help to reduce the number of serious illnesses or injuries that cause missed work days. </p>
<p>While these professions are singled out as among the worst, it is also important to remember that injuries can happen in any industry. All employers need to put safety first so their own workers don&#8217;t end up suffering injuries that require a long (and expensive) recovery period.<br />

								<p>On March 12, 2013, the <a>Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reported that hiring in certain sectors started to pick up in January, although the overall hiring rate remained fairly stagnant.  The BLS also reported that number of job openings in January was up in many sectors, indicating that more qualified workers may soon be finding positions if they haven&#8217;t already.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> know that new workers coming onto a worksite may be at risk of being injured because they are unfamiliar with procedures and customs at their new workplace. This is especially true of the long-term unemployed who may have been out of the workforce for a lengthy period of time, with skills getting rusty, as they awaited improvement in the economy and a new job. As employers begin to bring in new hires, it is thus essential for worker safety to remain a top priority. </p>
<p><strong>Work Safety Needs to Remain a Top Focus</strong><br />
According to the March 12, 2013 press release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were 3.7 million available job openings on the last business day of the month of January. This reflects little change from the end of December. </li>
<li>The hires rate of 3.1 percent and the separations rate of 3 percent also did not show any significant changes from the end of December to the end of January. </li>
<li>The number of job openings available in January rose in certain sectors including the professional and business services sector.</li>
<li>The number of job openings in January decreased in the areas of health care and social assistance. </li>
<li>The number of job openings, not seasonally adjusted, in January increased over the course of the year in non-farm jobs, in private jobs and in government jobs. </li>
<li>There were increases in available work opportunities and jobs in the retail sector; in other services and in the federal government. There was a decrease in jobs in the fields of mining and logging. </li>
</ul>
<p>As this data shows, some workplaces are not expanding while others are increasing their hiring and creating a situation where new employees assume duties. </p>
<p><strong>Workplace Safety Should be a Top Focus</strong><br />
In workplaces where the number of jobs are declining, workplace safety must be maintained even in the face of a smaller workforce. This means making sure that workers aren&#8217;t overworked and that people aren&#8217;t assigned to do tasks that they don&#8217;t have proper training for. </p>
<p>As hiring grows, workplaces bringing on new workers also face their own challenges in staying focused on safety. Even with the administrative costs associated with growth, employers still must be sure that safety programs remain in place and that the work environment complies with all OSHA guidelines. All new hires also need to be properly trained and adequately supervised when first hired to make sure that they are not at risk of getting hurt or causing harm to others as a result of their inexperience. </p>
<p>By making sure to stay focused on safety, companies will be poised to deal with any economic news that comes their way, including an increase in business growth that boosts their employee numbers. Keeping workers safe should always be he top priority under any situation.<br />
