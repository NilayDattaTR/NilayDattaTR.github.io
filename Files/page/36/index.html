									<div class="entry-content">
								<p>In the beginning of the year, the <a href="http://osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=19119" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) announced it was not going to make any changes to the Provisions for Feasible Administrative or Engineering Controls of Occupational Noise. They were at one time going to interpret the regulations to help to clarify what exactly &#8220;feasible administrative or engineering controls&#8221; meant. These changes and this clarification were going to help reduce the risks of hearing-related accidents and other <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work accidents in Atlanta</a> and elsewhere.&#8221;Hearing loss caused by excessive noise levels remains a serious occupational health problem in this country,&#8221; said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. </p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Georgia workers compensation attorneys</a> understand that OSHA decided to withdraw from its commitment to update these provisions because it required more resources and more public outreach than they had originally anticipated. They stated that the administration was going to have to do a little bit more research on work-related noise hazards and prevention strategies before it was able to make any changes to the provision.  </p>
<p>Now, OSHA released a statement saying it was going to hold an informal <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=20829" target="_blank">OSHA stakeholder</a> meeting to encourage suggestions and comments about work-related, hearing-loss prevention tactics. OSHA is asking stakeholders to share their thoughts and ideas for potential hearing conservation programs, which could include engineering controls and advances in personal protective equipment. The stakeholder meeting will be held Nov. 3 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>It is estimated that nearly 25,000 workers lose their hearing because of work-related incidents every year. To help to prevent these types of accidents, OSHA is asking for input from public health professionals, noise control experts, workers and employers.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting Information:</strong></p>
<p>Location: Frances Perkins Building, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-4437 A/B/C/D Address:  200 Constitution Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C.<br />
Contact:  You can <a href="https://www2.ergweb.com/projects/conferences/osha/register-osha-stakeholder.htm" target="_blank">Register online</a>. Or call (781) 674-7374 or send a fax to (781) 674-7200.<br />
Fax Cover Letter:  &#8220;Attention: OSHA Preventing Occupational Hearing Loss Stakeholder Meeting.&#8221; Be sure to include the stakeholder&#8217;s name, contact information and the affiliated company or organization.</p>
<p>All participants must complete the registration information before Oct. 27.</p>
<p><strong>OSHA pulled the interpretation&#8217;s proposal back in January, but said it would continue to:</strong></p>
<p>-Thoroughly review all of the comments and concerns that are submitted in response to the Federal Register notice.</p>
<p>-Hold the stakeholders meeting.</p>
<p>-Work closely with experts from the <a href="http://www.nae.edu/" target="_blank">National Academy of Engineering</a> and the National Institute for Occupational Safety for more research on the topic.</p>
<p>-Continue to research and enforce current regulations in an effort to make sure that the guidance and information regarding controls for dangerous noise levels are effective and inexpensive for employers and employees.</p>
<p>Hearing-related work accidents are very serious and can change a workers life forever.  If you&#8217;ve experienced an accident on the job, it is critical for you to contact an experienced attorney to help you to fight for the compensation you deserve.<br />

								<p>Because a worker fell off of a Ferris wheel, a Georgia company is facing fines of more than $27,000, according to <a href="http://www.myfox8.com/news/wghp-story-carnival-accident-110912,0,3290710.story" target="_blank">FOX 8</a>.  </p>
<p>The carnival accident happened back in May at the Greensboro carnival. According to the Greensboro News &amp; Record, Event Coordinators Inc., which is located in Augusta, has been issued a dozen citations from the North Carolina Department of Labor.  The company was also issued one non-serious violation for violating the Occupational Safety and Health Act of North Carolina. Each fine ranges between $900 and $3,500. The company has 15 days to either appeal the citations or to pay the fines.Companies are required to provide safe equipment and material for customers, but in doing so its required to keep workers safe and to prevent <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work accidents in Georgia </a>and elsewhere. Federal law requires that all of the proper safety precautions are taken to avoid such accidents.  If an injury results from a work hazard, the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/" target="_blank">Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration</a> will step in to investigate the scene. If hazards were failed to be addressed, companies and employers can face a number of serious violations, citations and fines.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers compensation lawyers</a> report that the man who was killed after falling off of this Ferris wheel at the Greensboro Youth Council&#8217;s yearly carnival was a 42-year-old employee from Columbus, Georgia. The carnival was held this year at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex. Carnival workers are used to working under time restrictions, but must be cautious and careful when assembling and taking down equipment as this is the time when the most accidents occur.</p>
<p>The man was killed as he was taking apart the Ferris wheel as the carnival was packing up. A second worker was injured during the incident. According to local officials, one of the fittings on the wheel&#8217;s wire cable that is used to disassemble the ride failed.  </p>
<p>Reports indicate that the Columbus worker fell more than 40 feet to the paved ground after a portion of the wheel came free and hit a nearby walkway. The other worker who was injured in the incident reportedly fell nearly 30 feet after the loose part struck an elevated basket on the wheel.</p>
<p>&#8220;The penalties are in no way designed to make up for loss of life,&#8221; said a spokesman for the Labor Department, Neal O&#8217;Briant, Labor Department Spokesman. He reports that the money collected from the fines will be given to the Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund, which provides funds to public schools in the area.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owasrch.search_form?p_doc_type=oshact" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970</a>, employees and representatives have the legal right to file a complaint and request that OSHA look into complaints and conduct an inspection of the work site. A complaint may be filed if an employee feels that there is a serious hazard that an employer may be neglecting to recognize or address. Under the Act, the name of the person who filed the complaint is not released to help protect their identity from employers and to encourage more people to step up and address these concerns.</p>
<p>Employees should not fear voicing concerns regarding a work-related hazard. It is against federal law for an employer to take any retaliating action again an employee who speaks out. Employers are prohibited from demoting, transferring, firing or discriminating against any employees who files a complaint.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/osha7/eComplaintForm.html" target="_blank">OSHA&#8217;s complaint web page</a> to fill out a form regarding a work-related hazard that you&#8217;ve witnessed. Your concern can help to prevent an injury or to save a life.<br />

								<p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.nr0.htm" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> recently released its preliminary estimates of fatal <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work accidents in Georgia</a> and elsewhere, which showed that in 2010, more than 4,500 employees died as a result of work-related injuries.</p>
<p>That amounts to about a fatal work injury rate of 3.5 per 100,000 full-time equivalent employees for U.S. workers for the year.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers compensation attorneys</a> understand that the final 2010 data for this information will not be released until the Spring of 2012. Until then, this is the most recent information available. It&#8217;s no surprise that a number of economic factors play a role in the number of fatal work injuries sustained every year. These factors include total hours worked, which was up slightly in 2010 in comparison to both 2008 and 2009. </p>
<p><strong>According to the newly released data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There was a 5 percent decrease in the number of work-related fatalities experienced by those who were self-employed. This workforce experienced nearly 1,000 fatal work injuries in 2010.  </li>
<li>The private mining industry experienced nearly 200 fatal work injuries in 2010.  This amounts to an increase of nearly 75 percent from the previous year. The rate of fatal work injuries in this industry was nearly 20 per 100,000 FTEs in 2010.</li>
<li>The private construction industry was fortunate enough to experience a 10 percent decrease in the number of fatal work injuries from 2009 to 2010. The number of these injuries is down approximately 40 percent from 2006.</li>
<li>The number of work-related injuries caused by fires more than doubled from 2009 to 2010. There were more than 100 of these incidents in 2010, which is the highest number on record.</li>
<li>The number of workplace homicides involving women increased by more than 10 percent from 2009 to 2010. Although this number increased for women, the number for all workers decreased by about 7 percent from the previous year, which is the lowest number ever recorded.</li>
<li>Fatal work injuries among African-American and non-Hispanic workers declined by nearly 10 percent from the previous year, although the number of these incidents increased by more than 2 percent within the non-Hispanic worker category.</li>
<li>Work-related deaths involving Latino or Hispanic employees has declined nearly 5 percent.</li>
<li>Police officers experienced an approximate 40 percent increase in the number of fatal work accidents from 2009 to 2010. These workers experienced less than 100 fatal work accidents in 2009, but the number spiked to more than 130 in 2010.</li>
<li>The total number of worked hours for those both hourly and salary employees increased in 2010. Unfortunately, these hours decreased for those who are self-employed.  </li>
<li>The number of fatal work injuries sustained by women increased by more than 5 percent, but decreased by only 1 percent for men.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The number of work injuries sustained by employees who were under the age of 18, workers age 25 to 34, and workers ages 55-years-old and older recorded a decrease in the number of these accidents.  </p>
<p>There are twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia that reported to have experienced an increase in the number of fatal work injuries from 2009 to 2010. Only 23 states reported to have experienced a decrease in the number of these fatal accidents.<br />

								<p>Jim Boyd Construction, Piedmont Mechanical Inc. and Chevron Energy have been cited by the <a href="http://www.osha.gov./pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=20664" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) for a number of safety violations that were discovered after a worker was burned as the result of a preventable electrical shock. The accident happened at the U.S. Marine Corps Logistic Base as the employee was installing a new land fill gas compression and processing facility. The companies affiliated with the construction have received eleven citations that equal more than $189,000. The OSHA inspection started back in March after the accident.OSHA is responsible for investigating the conditions of work sites and <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work-related accidents in Georgia</a> and elsewhere. Employers have a responsibility under federal law to help to protect workers from hazards and dangers that can result in injury at the work site.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers compensation attorneys</a> understand that employees who work with electrical equipment are at an increased risk for serious work-related injuries if the proper precautionary steps are not taken by all parties involved. Workers are urged to report any signs of hazards or dangers in the workplace to a supervisor or directly to OSHA. Your report can help to prevent injury or to save someone&#8217;s life if the concerns are properly handled.</p>
<p>The recently issued citations were the result of an accident where the boom tip of a crane made contact with a power line that was running with more than 12,000 volts.  When the tip of the crane made contact, the electricity was transported through the crane and down to the employee who was located on the ground and holding the line.</p>
<p>Piedmont received a violation of more than a $55,000 penalty for neglecting to consider that the crane would get that close to the power line. Cranes are not allowed within 20 feet of working power lines. The other citations were received for neglecting to position the crane on an area that was sturdy enough to support it and for neglecting to inspect the crane daily.</p>
<p><strong>All of the companies have been cited for excavation and trenching-related violations at that one specific work site:  </strong></p>
<p>-Piedmont: $125,000+.</p>
<p>-Jim Boyd: $58,000+.</p>
<p>-Chevron Energy: $6,300.</p>
<p>&#8220;When there are multiple companies operating together at the same site . . . it is important that all the employers take a serious interest in the safety and health of the workers,&#8221; said Robert Vazzi, director of OSHA&#8217;s Savannah Area Office.</p>
<p>Additional violations were issued to both Peidmont and Jim Boyd for allowing its employees to enter a trench in which there were a number of sections where shields were not connected properly. Both companies were also cited for letting employees work in these areas where she shields were damaged along the walls of the trench. This exposed the employees to a number of potentially serious hazards.<br />

								<p>Each year, roughly 2 million workers report that they have been the victim of workplace violence. The truth is that a great number of cases are expected to be unreported, so the actual number is much higher.  </p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics&#8217; <a href="http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm" target="_blank">Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries</a> (CFOI) reports that in 2010, more than 4,500 people died because of fatal workplace injuries.  More than 500 of these deaths were workplace homicides. Homicide is the number one cause of death for females in the workplace.  </p>
<p>No one should be subjected to violent acts in the workplace and there can be compensation that can be provided to those who have been the victim of violent <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">workplace injuries in Atlanta</a> and elsewhere.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Georgia workers compensation attorneys</a> understand how common these types of work injuries are. As a matter of fact, workplace violence is one of the top four causes of all workplace fatalities in the last 15 years.  More than 3,000 workers have died from on-the-job homicide from the just 2006 to 2010.  Another 15,000 workers were injured during this time because of workplace violence.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/workplaceviolence/index.html" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> recently released a new directive on its Enforcement Procedures for Investigating or Inspecting Incidents of Workplace Violence. Under the new directive, OSHA members will have to follow a new set of rules pertaining to the investigation of workplace violence reports.  They will also have to conduct more frequent and more thorough inspections on industries in which workplace violence is more prominent. Some of these industries include social service and healthcare settings, and late-night retail establishments, such as convenience stores and 24-hour sit-in restaurants.</p>
<p>One of the most recent cases of workplace violence came after an OSHA inspection of a psychiatric hospital in Maine. The inspections revealed on-duty workers were assaulted more than 90 times by patients. These reports were collected from 2008 to 2010.  </p>
<p>That Maine hospital has been cited for not providing those workers with efficient and adequate protection against the workplace violence. The hospital must now pay approximately $6,000 in fines. The Administration has handed over similar citations to facilities in Massachusetts and in New York where workers were killed as the result or workplace assaults.</p>
<p>&#8220;These incidents and others like them can be avoided or decreased if employers take appropriate precautions to protect their workers,&#8221; said Dr. David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health.&#8221;<br />
<strong><br />
How to help prevent the risks of workplace violence:<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enact a zero-tolerance policy. Make sure that all employees, clients, patients, contractors, visitors, etc. are covered under the policy. This policy should ensure that an employer will take the proper actions if a violent act or threat is reported.</li>
<li>Frequently assess worksites. Create a written Workplace Violence Prevention Program. The program should include administrative and engineering controls along with a form of training so that everyone can better understand and recognize workplace violence.</li>
<li>Let all employees know about their legal right to prosecute perpetrators in the event of becoming the victim of workplace violence.</li>
<li>Ensure that employees understand how to report a violent act and who to report it to. Ensure that everyone knows that these reports will be taken seriously and all of them will be both investigated and remedied immediately.  </li>
<li>Make sure that no employee who reports a violent act in the workplace faces reprisals.</li>

								<p>According to the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=20460" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a>, Excelso Coffee and Tea Co. recently received nearly 20 safety violations for having traces of combustible dust and other various hazards in the workplace.  Its Norcross manufacturing facility was responsible for the violations.  This is where the company conducts a number of its tea and coffee blending tests and operations.  </p>
<p>A Site-Specific Targeting program warranted the investigation of the facility back in April.  This program, operated by OSHA, aims to direct its enforcement efforts to businesses of work sites that have a history of high rates of illnesses and <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work-related injuries in Atlanta</a> and elsewhere.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> continue to follow issues combustible dust in the workplace &#8212; which has led to a number of plant explosions in recent years. A company can be fined and sued for deserved compensation if they do not take the proper safety precautions to protect  employees.  Excelso Coffee and Tea Co. received nearly $47,000 in proposed fines.</p>
<p><strong>The company received fourteen citations for violating a number of safety regulations.  These violations were for:</strong></p>
<p>-Failing to keep steel beams and floors at the facility free of tea and coffee dust.</p>
<p>-Failing to have insulation devices to help prevent explosions and fires near the dust collector.</p>
<p>-Failing to have an emergency plan.</p>
<p>-Employees were not trained on how to properly use fire extinguishers.</p>
<p>-Not properly storing wiring in an electrical panel.</p>
<p>-Not having machine guards on equipment on the packaging lines.</p>
<p>-Not properly training employees on the operations of a forklift.  </p>
<p>-Stairs lacked standard railings and guardrails.</p>
<p>-Using flexible cords as permanent wiring.</p>
<p>-Improperly adjusting bench grinders.</p>
<p>-Not using the air compressor properly to clean equipment.</p>
<p>-The facility did not have a station for employees to wash their eyes of harmful debris.</p>
<p>-Employees were not given protection to keep their hands safe from heat and sharp objects.<br />
<strong><br />
The company received a number of less-serious violations, including:</strong></p>
<p>-Failing to keep track of injuries that occurred from 2007 to 2009.  </p>
<p>-Failing to properly mark &#8220;exit&#8221; signs at the facility.</p>
<p>-Failing to provide employees that require a respirator with a proper medical evaluation.</p>
<p>-Blocking the facility&#8217;s electrical panels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fixing these violations now is a lot easier than recovering from a fire or explosion that can result in injuries or even loss of life,&#8221; says William Fulcher, director of OSHA&#8217;s Atlanta-East Area Office. </p>
<p>The coffee company has 15 business days to deal with the violations.  They have the option of paying the fines, contesting the fines or requesting a meeting with their local OSHA office.  </p>
<p>If you observe unsafe working conditions at your place of employment or at any other work facility, you can report your findings to OSHA by calling 800-321-OSHA (6742).</p>
<p>If you are injured on the job, it is important for you to contact an experienced lawyer to help you fight for the proper compensation.  Injuries and sufferings can include medical bills and work-loss costs.  You should not be responsible for these costs, especially if the hazard could have been prevented by your employer.<br />

								<p>The number of young employed workers in the United States, ages 16- to 24-years-old, increased by nearly 2 percent from April to July of this year.  Now there are nearly 19 million workers in this age group.  According to the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/youth.nr0.htm" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, less than 50 percent of residents in that young age group were employed in July of 2011. </p>
<p>This marked the lowest employment rate for our youths on record since 1948.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> were surprised with these numbers because July is typically a time when our youth hit the job market in full force because of summer break.  They use this summer break to earn some extra money before they head back to school for the year.  During the school year, young workers are under stricter regulations regarding their work abilities.  From this April to July of this year, the number of unemployed workers in this age group rose by about 745,000.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s so difficult for residents to find work, many adults are applying for jobs that were once held for teens.  This trend has a negative affect because it forces teens to apply for jobs that they&#8217;re not suited for and it could even leave them at an increased risk for a <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work-related injury in Georgia</a>.  They may also be less likely to voice their concerns about unsafe work environments if they believe that their job could be in jeopardy because of it.  </p>
<p>Young people who were actively looking for jobs or were currently working in the month of July 2011 totaled nearly 60 percent, which again is the lowest July rate on record.</p>
<p>More than 25 percent of young workers were employed in the hospitality and leisure sector.   Another 20 percent worked in the retail trade industry.  </p>
<p>Parents are urged to be active in their teen&#8217;s employment choices.  Many teens are unaware of their rights as an employee.  Parents should be actively involved in their child&#8217;s work to ensure that they&#8217;re safe and are being treated fairly on the job.</p>
<p>Workers who are ages 14- and 15-years-old are only allowed to work 3 hours each day and only 18 hours a week during the school year.  They&#8217;re allowed to work 8 hour days and 40 hour weeks when school is not in session.  Employees of this age are not allowed to work passed 7:00 p.m. during school and no later than 9:00 p.m. from June 1st to Labor Day.  </p>
<p>Workers who are ages 16- and 17-years-old are allowed to be employed for as many hours a week as they&#8217;d like, but they cannot be employed at a job that has been declared hazardous by the Secretary of Labor. </p>
<p>Employees who are at least 18-years-old no longer have to abide by the federal youth employment and child labor law requirements.  They are free to work under adult employee regulations.<br />

									<div class="entry-content">
								<p>The <a href="http://63.234.227.130/dep/oia/whistleblower/index.html" target="_blank">Whistleblower Protections Program</a> is currently enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor&#8217;s <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=20394" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA). The law aims to protect employees who bring up safety concerns on the job to help prevent a <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work injury in Georgia</a> or elsewhere.  Employees are protected from any form of retaliation from the employer, including being discharged or being discriminated against if they bring up or report any form of unsafe work concerns.  Employees have the right to bring up concerns under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/osha.html" target="_blank">Occupational Safety and Health Act</a>.OSHA recently announced that it made this program even more beneficial.  The program now uses 21 statutes to protect American workers who report any sort of safety concerns or on the job safety violations.  These statues cover commercial motor carrier, environmental, health care reform, pipeline, railroad, airline, commercial motor carrier, financial reform, nuclear, public transportation agency and securities laws.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> understand how important the Whistleblower Protections Program is as employers have been known to take disciplinary actions against those who raise these types of concerns in the workplace.  Even when these concerns are brought up, they can be ignored by employers.  It is important to speak up and contact an attorney if you find yourself being discriminated against after discussing safe work procedures at your job.  Employers are required to provide safe work conditions to all employees and must abide by a number of laws, regulations and recommendations when doing so.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability of workers to speak out and exercise their legal rights without fear of retaliation is crucial to many of the legal protections and safeguards that all Americans value,&#8221; said Dr. David Michaels, OSHA&#8217;s Assistant Secretary. &#8220;The new measures will significantly strengthen OSHA&#8217;s enforcement of the 21 whistleblower laws that Congress charged OSHA with administering.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Some of the changes that have been made in the Whistleblower Protection Program are as follows:</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Training:</strong>  Federal and state whistleblower investigators will be attending a training conference next month so that the Administration can ensure that all employees have completed all mandatory training classes and will be up with the new changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Program Policy:</strong>  OSHA will release a new edition of their Whistleblower Investigations Manual.  The new manual will include the new procedures and information pertaining to all of the new laws that have been added since the program was last updated back in 2003.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Restructuring:</strong>  The Program will now be required to report to the assistant secretary instead of being operating in the Directorate of Enforcement.  The Administration is also in the process of a pilot project that aims to find better ways to track and hold the Program more accountable for its accomplishments and activities.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Internal Systems: </strong> Internal systems are being modified so that employee complaints can be taken care of in a timely manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;OSHA is committed to correcting the issues brought to light by the GAO report and our own review,&#8221; said Dr. Michaels.<br />

								<p>A <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">work accident in Georgia</a> left one Georgia Power Company employee dead after he was electrocuted while working on a line at a job site that was just east of Brookfield, according to the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/ga-power-lineman-electrocuted-1097843.html" target="_blank">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>.  The accident reportedly occurred earlier this month on U.S. 82.</p>
<p>The accident happened as the Georgia Power Company was attempting to restore power after weather conditions took down a power line, according to Steve Wood, the Tift County Coroner.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Georgia workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> would like to point out that the man who was fatally injured had been working as a lineman for more than 20 years.  He was employed with Georgia Power for nearly four of those 20 years.  We point this out because it shows that no kind of experience and/or training can completely prevent serious work accidents.  It is only with the precautionary safety measures that we can all make an attempt to prevent these serious accidents.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reports that, over the last 10 years, electrical injury has resulted in an average of roughly 320 deaths each year in the United States.  These incidents have also been credited for causing roughly 4,000 injuries that have required days away from work. Electrical injury is the second leading cause of death in the construction industry.  These accidents consistently make up between 5 and 6 percent of all work deaths.  More specifically, of the injuries that are caused by contact with overhead power lines, roughly 26 to 60 percent of the cases resulted in more than 30 days out of work.  Only 18 to 20 percent of all other occupational injuries and illnesses require that much time away from work.  </p>
<p>Injuries that result from electrical work can be extremely costly, not only for the worker but for their families as well.  Dr. Ronald Wyzga of the <a href="http://my.epri.com/portal/server.pt?" target="_blank">Electric Power Research Institute</a>, Palo Alto, California, conducted a study that concluded that electrical injuries are among the costliest for employers, in both direct and indirect costs.<br />
<strong><br />
Common power line and electrical myths busted:</strong></p>
<p>-If birds can stand on the power lines, then they must be safe for me to touch: False.<br />
The reason why birds aren&#8217;t electrocuted when they land on a power line is because they do not represent a path to the ground.  Electricity is only looking for a way to get to the ground.  When a bird is sitting on a wire, it does not give the electricity anywhere to go. </p>
<p>-Because power lines are insulated, then they must be okay to touch: False.<br />
Power line are insulated, but they&#8217;re only insulated enough to prevent problems from tree contact.</p>
<p>-If my ladder isn&#8217;t metal, then it&#8217;s okay to rest on the power line: False.<br />
Electricity is always looking for a conductor and metal is an excellent candidate for a conductor!  Don&#8217;t forget that water is also an excellent conductor, so no matter what your ladder may be made of, if it is wet then it can be a hazard.</p>
<p>-I have to dig a few inches into the ground.  I shouldn&#8217;t worry about power lines: False.<br />
You&#8217;ve got to take into account when the lines were buried, if the ground shifted and whether or not you could accidentally dig deeper than intended.<br />

									<div class="entry-content">
								<p>Blue Bird Corp., a Georgia-based school bus manufacturer, recently struck a deal with the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=2023" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Labor</a> to settle a lawsuit filed by the department claiming that the company illegally terminated a maintenance employee because the employee raised safety concerns regarding the proper use of a bucket lift to avoid a <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/lawyer-attorney-1637456.html">Georgia work accident</a>. </p>
<p>The company now has to pay the employee $170,800 in back wages and nearly $6,000 in interest.Our <a href="https://www.jfblaw.com/">Atlanta workers&#8217; compensation attorneys</a> would like to remind employers that all employees must be trained on the operations of equipment and the safety measures to be taken when operating the equipment on the job.  In this lawsuit, the employee requested training in the operation of the bucket life, but when the request started an argument with management, the employee was terminated for refusing to work under unsafe conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;After much litigation, we are pleased with the successful settlement of this case in favor of the employee. The courts confirmed the Labor Department&#8217;s argument that every employee has the right to report any safety concerns in the workplace without fear of retaliation,&#8221; said Cindy Coe, administrator of OSHA&#8217;s Atlanta Regional Office. &#8220;The Labor Department will hold companies accountable when they violate basic worker rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a number of whistleblower provisions that have been enacted by Congress that are aimed at preventing employers from retaliating against employees who raise concerns or provide protected information to the employer or to the government about unsafe work conditions.</p>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has recently cited the Walgreens Co. store on Covington Highway in Lithonia with four safety violations for exposing workers to struck-by and other hazards. Penalties total $104,500.</p>
<p>Three repeat violations with $99,000 in penalties include exposing employees to being struck by unsecured compressed gas cylinders; allowing workers to use an A-frame stepladder to carry inventory up and down, and then step from the ladder onto a storage shelf to load and retrieve products without guardrails or fall protection; and failing to ensure exit routes are not blocked. A repeat violation exists when an employer previously has been cited for the same or a similar violation of a standard, regulation, rule or order at any other facility in federal enforcement states within the last five years. The company was cited for the same three violations in May 2008 at a Chicago, Ill., location.</p>
<p>Another Georgia company was reprimanded for <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&p_id=20256" target="_blank">compromising worker&#8217;s safety</a>.  Deerfield, Ill.-based Walgreens Co., a chain of pharmacy/retail stores, was handed four safety violations for exposing workers to struck-by and other hazards. These penalties totaled $104,500.</p>
<p>They were cited for exposing employees to the possibility of being struck by unsecured compressed gas cylinders, allowing workers to misuse an A-frame stepladder and failing to ensure exit routes are not blocked.  They were cited with a serious violation for allowing electrical panel access to be blocked by display material, plastics totes and inventory. </p>
<p>&#8220;This employer failed to address common and basic hazards posed by blocked exits, falls from heights and being struck by a heavy gas cylinder,&#8221; said Bill Fulcher, director of OSHA&#8217;s Atlanta-East Area Office, which conducted an investigation in January. &#8220;All employers have a responsibility to keep the work environment safe for their employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deerfield has 15 business days from the receipt of the citations and proposed penalties to request a conference with OSHA&#8217;s area director, comply or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.<br />
